 Book 01 Genesis

 01:001:001 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

 01:001:002 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

 01:001:003 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

 01:001:004 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.

 01:001:005 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

 01:001:006 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

 01:001:007 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.

 01:001:008 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.

 01:001:009 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.

 01:001:010 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

 01:001:011 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

 01:001:012 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

 01:001:013 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

 01:001:014 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:

 01:001:015 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.

 01:001:016 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

 01:001:017 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,

 01:001:018 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

 01:001:019 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

 01:001:020 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.

 01:001:021 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

 01:001:022 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.

 01:001:023 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

 01:001:024 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.

 01:001:025 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

 01:001:026 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

 01:001:027 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.

 01:001:028 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

 01:001:029 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.

 01:001:030 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.

 01:001:031 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

 01:002:001 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.

 01:002:002 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

 01:002:003 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

 01:002:004 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,

 01:002:005 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.

 01:002:006 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.

 01:002:007 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

 01:002:008 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.

 01:002:009 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

 01:002:010 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

 01:002:011 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

 01:002:012 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.

 01:002:013 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

 01:002:014 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.

 01:002:015 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.

 01:002:016 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:

 01:002:017 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.

 01:002:018 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

 01:002:019 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.

 01:002:020 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.

 01:002:021 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;

 01:002:022 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.

 01:002:023 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

 01:002:024 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

 01:002:025 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

 01:003:001 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

 01:003:002 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:

 01:003:003 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

 01:003:004 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

 01:003:005 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

 01:003:006 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.

 01:003:007 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.

 01:003:008 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.

 01:003:009 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?

 01:003:010 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.

 01:003:011 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?

 01:003:012 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

 01:003:013 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

 01:003:014 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:

 01:003:015 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

 01:003:016 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.

 01:003:017 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;

 01:003:018 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;

 01:003:019 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

 01:003:020 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.

 01:003:021 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.

 01:003:022 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:

 01:003:023 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.

 01:003:024 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

 01:004:001 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

 01:004:002 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

 01:004:003 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

 01:004:004 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:

 01:004:005 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

 01:004:006 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?

 01:004:007 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

 01:004:008 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.

 01:004:009 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?

 01:004:010 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.

 01:004:011 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;

 01:004:012 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.

 01:004:013 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.

 01:004:014 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.

 01:004:015 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

 01:004:016 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

 01:004:017 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.

 01:004:018 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

 01:004:019 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

 01:004:020 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.

 01:004:021 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.

 01:004:022 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.

 01:004:023 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

 01:004:024 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.

 01:004:025 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.

 01:004:026 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.

 01:005:001 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;

 01:005:002 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.

 01:005:003 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth:

 01:005:004 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:

 01:005:005 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.

 01:005:006 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:

 01:005:007 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:

 01:005:008 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.

 01:005:009 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:

 01:005:010 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:

 01:005:011 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.

 01:005:012 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel:

 01:005:013 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:

 01:005:014 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.

 01:005:015 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:

 01:005:016 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:

 01:005:017 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.

 01:005:018 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:

 01:005:019 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:

 01:005:020 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.

 01:005:021 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:

 01:005:022 And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:

 01:005:023 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:

 01:005:024 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.

 01:005:025 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech.

 01:005:026 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:

 01:005:027 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.

 01:005:028 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:

 01:005:029 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed.

 01:005:030 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:

 01:005:031 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.

 01:005:032 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

 01:006:001 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,

 01:006:002 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.

 01:006:003 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.

 01:006:004 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.

 01:006:005 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.

 01:006:006 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.

 01:006:007 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.

 01:006:008 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.

 01:006:009 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.

 01:006:010 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

 01:006:011 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.

 01:006:012 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

 01:006:013 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

 01:006:014 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

 01:006:015 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.

 01:006:016 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.

 01:006:017 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.

 01:006:018 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.

 01:006:019 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.

 01:006:020 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.

 01:006:021 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.

 01:006:022 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.

 01:007:001 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.

 01:007:002 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.

 01:007:003 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

 01:007:004 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.

 01:007:005 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.

 01:007:006 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.

 01:007:007 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.

 01:007:008 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,

 01:007:009 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.

 01:007:010 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.

 01:007:011 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.

 01:007:012 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

 01:007:013 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;

 01:007:014 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.

 01:007:015 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.

 01:007:016 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.

 01:007:017 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.

 01:007:018 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

 01:007:019 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.

 01:007:020 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.

 01:007:021 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:

 01:007:022 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.

 01:007:023 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.

 01:007:024 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.

 01:008:001 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;

 01:008:002 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;

 01:008:003 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.

 01:008:004 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

 01:008:005 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.

 01:008:006 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:

 01:008:007 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.

 01:008:008 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;

 01:008:009 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.

 01:008:010 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;

 01:008:011 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.

 01:008:012 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.

 01:008:013 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.

 01:008:014 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.

 01:008:015 And God spake unto Noah, saying,

 01:008:016 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.

 01:008:017 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.

 01:008:018 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:

 01:008:019 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.

 01:008:020 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

 01:008:021 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.

 01:008:022 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.

 01:009:001 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.

 01:009:002 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.

 01:009:003 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.

 01:009:004 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.

 01:009:005 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.

 01:009:006 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.

 01:009:007 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.

 01:009:008 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

 01:009:009 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;

 01:009:010 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

 01:009:011 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

 01:009:012 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:

 01:009:013 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.

 01:009:014 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:

 01:009:015 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

 01:009:016 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

 01:009:017 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.

 01:009:018 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.

 01:009:019 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.

 01:009:020 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

 01:009:021 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.

 01:009:022 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.

 01:009:023 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.

 01:009:024 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.

 01:009:025 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.

 01:009:026 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

 01:009:027 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

 01:009:028 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

 01:009:029 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.

 01:010:001 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

 01:010:002 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

 01:010:003 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

 01:010:004 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

 01:010:005 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

 01:010:006 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

 01:010:007 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.

 01:010:008 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.

 01:010:009 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.

 01:010:010 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

 01:010:011 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,

 01:010:012 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.

 01:010:013 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,

 01:010:014 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.

 01:010:015 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,

 01:010:016 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,

 01:010:017 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

 01:010:018 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

 01:010:019 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

 01:010:020 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

 01:010:021 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.

 01:010:022 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.

 01:010:023 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

 01:010:024 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

 01:010:025 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.

 01:010:026 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,

 01:010:027 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

 01:010:028 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

 01:010:029 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.

 01:010:030 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.

 01:010:031 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

 01:010:032 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.

 01:011:001 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

 01:011:002 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.

 01:011:003 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.

 01:011:004 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

 01:011:005 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.

 01:011:006 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

 01:011:007 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.

 01:011:008 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

 01:011:009 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

 01:011:010 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:

 01:011:011 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.

 01:011:012 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:

 01:011:013 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.

 01:011:014 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:

 01:011:015 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.

 01:011:016 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:

 01:011:017 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.

 01:011:018 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:

 01:011:019 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.

 01:011:020 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:

 01:011:021 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.

 01:011:022 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

 01:011:023 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.

 01:011:024 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:

 01:011:025 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.

 01:011:026 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

 01:011:027 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

 01:011:028 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

 01:011:029 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

 01:011:030 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

 01:011:031 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.

 01:011:032 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.

 01:012:001 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:

 01:012:002 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:

 01:012:003 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

 01:012:004 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.

 01:012:005 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.

 01:012:006 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.

 01:012:007 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.

 01:012:008 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.

 01:012:009 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

 01:012:010 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.

 01:012:011 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:

 01:012:012 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.

 01:012:013 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.

 01:012:014 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

 01:012:015 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

 01:012:016 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.

 01:012:017 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.

 01:012:018 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?

 01:012:019 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.

 01:012:020 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.

 01:013:001 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.

 01:013:002 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

 01:013:003 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;

 01:013:004 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.

 01:013:005 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.

 01:013:006 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.

 01:013:007 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.

 01:013:008 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.

 01:013:009 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.

 01:013:010 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.

 01:013:011 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.

 01:013:012 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

 01:013:013 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.

 01:013:014 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:

 01:013:015 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.

 01:013:016 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.

 01:013:017 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.

 01:013:018 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.

 01:014:001 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;

 01:014:002 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.

 01:014:003 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.

 01:014:004 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.

 01:014:005 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,

 01:014:006 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.

 01:014:007 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.

 01:014:008 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;

 01:014:009 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.

 01:014:010 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.

 01:014:011 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.

 01:014:012 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.

 01:014:013 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.

 01:014:014 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.

 01:014:015 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.

 01:014:016 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.

 01:014:017 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.

 01:014:018 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.

 01:014:019 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:

 01:014:020 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

 01:014:021 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.

 01:014:022 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,

 01:014:023 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:

 01:014:024 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.

 01:015:001 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.

 01:015:002 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?

 01:015:003 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

 01:015:004 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

 01:015:005 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.

 01:015:006 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.

 01:015:007 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

 01:015:008 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?

 01:015:009 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

 01:015:010 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.

 01:015:011 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.

 01:015:012 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.

 01:015:013 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;

 01:015:014 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.

 01:015:015 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.

 01:015:016 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

 01:015:017 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.

 01:015:018 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:

 01:015:019 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,

 01:015:020 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,

 01:015:021 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.

 01:016:001 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

 01:016:002 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

 01:016:003 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.

 01:016:004 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

 01:016:005 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.

 01:016:006 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.

 01:016:007 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

 01:016:008 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.

 01:016:009 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.

 01:016:010 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

 01:016:011 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.

 01:016:012 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.

 01:016:013 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?

 01:016:014 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.

 01:016:015 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.

 01:016:016 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.

 01:017:001 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.

 01:017:002 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.

 01:017:003 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,

 01:017:004 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.

 01:017:005 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.

 01:017:006 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

 01:017:007 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.

 01:017:008 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.

 01:017:009 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.

 01:017:010 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.

 01:017:011 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.

 01:017:012 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.

 01:017:013 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.

 01:017:014 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.

 01:017:015 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.

 01:017:016 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.

 01:017:017 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?

 01:017:018 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!

 01:017:019 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.

 01:017:020 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.

 01:017:021 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.

 01:017:022 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.

 01:017:023 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.

 01:017:024 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

 01:017:025 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

 01:017:026 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.

 01:017:027 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.

 01:018:001 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;

 01:018:002 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,

 01:018:003 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

 01:018:004 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:

 01:018:005 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.

 01:018:006 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.

 01:018:007 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.

 01:018:008 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.

 01:018:009 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.

 01:018:010 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.

 01:018:011 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

 01:018:012 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?

 01:018:013 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?

 01:018:014 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.

 01:018:015 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

 01:018:016 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

 01:018:017 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;

 01:018:018 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?

 01:018:019 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.

 01:018:020 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;

 01:018:021 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.

 01:018:022 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.

 01:018:023 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?

 01:018:024 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?

 01:018:025 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?

 01:018:026 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

 01:018:027 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:

 01:018:028 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.

 01:018:029 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.

 01:018:030 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.

 01:018:031 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.

 01:018:032 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.

 01:018:033 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

 01:019:001 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;

 01:019:002 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.

 01:019:003 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.

 01:019:004 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:

 01:019:005 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.

 01:019:006 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,

 01:019:007 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.

 01:019:008 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.

 01:019:009 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.

 01:019:010 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.

 01:019:011 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.

 01:019:012 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:

 01:019:013 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.

 01:019:014 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.

 01:019:015 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

 01:019:016 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.

 01:019:017 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.

 01:019:018 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:

 01:019:019 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:

 01:019:020 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.

 01:019:021 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.

 01:019:022 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

 01:019:023 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

 01:019:024 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;

 01:019:025 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.

 01:019:026 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.

 01:019:027 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:

 01:019:028 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.

 01:019:029 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.

 01:019:030 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.

 01:019:031 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:

 01:019:032 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

 01:019:033 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.

 01:019:034 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

 01:019:035 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.

 01:019:036 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.

 01:019:037 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.

 01:019:038 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.

 01:020:001 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

 01:020:002 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

 01:020:003 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.

 01:020:004 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?

 01:020:005 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.

 01:020:006 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.

 01:020:007 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.

 01:020:008 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.

 01:020:009 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.

 01:020:010 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?

 01:020:011 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.

 01:020:012 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.

 01:020:013 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.

 01:020:014 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.

 01:020:015 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.

 01:020:016 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.

 01:020:017 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.

 01:020:018 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.

 01:021:001 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.

 01:021:002 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.

 01:021:003 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.

 01:021:004 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.

 01:021:005 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.

 01:021:006 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.

 01:021:007 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.

 01:021:008 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.

 01:021:009 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.

 01:021:010 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.

 01:021:011 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.

 01:021:012 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

 01:021:013 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.

 01:021:014 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

 01:021:015 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.

 01:021:016 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.

 01:021:017 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.

 01:021:018 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.

 01:021:019 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.

 01:021:020 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.

 01:021:021 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

 01:021:022 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:

 01:021:023 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.

 01:021:024 And Abraham said, I will swear.

 01:021:025 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.

 01:021:026 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.

 01:021:027 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.

 01:021:028 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

 01:021:029 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?

 01:021:030 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.

 01:021:031 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.

 01:021:032 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.

 01:021:033 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.

 01:021:034 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.

 01:022:001 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.

 01:022:002 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.

 01:022:003 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.

 01:022:004 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.

 01:022:005 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.

 01:022:006 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.

 01:022:007 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

 01:022:008 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.

 01:022:009 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

 01:022:010 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.

 01:022:011 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.

 01:022:012 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.

 01:022:013 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.

 01:022:014 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.

 01:022:015 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,

 01:022:016 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:

 01:022:017 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;

 01:022:018 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.

 01:022:019 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.

 01:022:020 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;

 01:022:021 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,

 01:022:022 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

 01:022:023 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.

 01:022:024 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

 01:023:001 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.

 01:023:002 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.

 01:023:003 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,

 01:023:004 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.

 01:023:005 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,

 01:023:006 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.

 01:023:007 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.

 01:023:008 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,

 01:023:009 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.

 01:023:010 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,

 01:023:011 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.

 01:023:012 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.

 01:023:013 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.

 01:023:014 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,

 01:023:015 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.

 01:023:016 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.

 01:023:017 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure

 01:023:018 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.

 01:023:019 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.

 01:023:020 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.

 01:024:001 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.

 01:024:002 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:

 01:024:003 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:

 01:024:004 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.

 01:024:005 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?

 01:024:006 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.

 01:024:007 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.

 01:024:008 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.

 01:024:009 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.

 01:024:010 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.

 01:024:011 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.

 01:024:012 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.

 01:024:013 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:

 01:024:014 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.

 01:024:015 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.

 01:024:016 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.

 01:024:017 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.

 01:024:018 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.

 01:024:019 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.

 01:024:020 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.

 01:024:021 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.

 01:024:022 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;

 01:024:023 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?

 01:024:024 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.

 01:024:025 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.

 01:024:026 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.

 01:024:027 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.

 01:024:028 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things.

 01:024:029 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.

 01:024:030 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.

 01:024:031 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.

 01:024:032 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.

 01:024:033 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.

 01:024:034 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.

 01:024:035 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.

 01:024:036 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.

 01:024:037 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:

 01:024:038 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.

 01:024:039 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.

 01:024:040 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:

 01:024:041 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.

 01:024:042 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:

 01:024:043 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;

 01:024:044 And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son.

 01:024:045 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.

 01:024:046 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.

 01:024:047 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.

 01:024:048 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.

 01:024:049 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.

 01:024:050 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.

 01:024:051 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.

 01:024:052 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.

 01:024:053 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.

 01:024:054 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.

 01:024:055 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.

 01:024:056 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.

 01:024:057 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.

 01:024:058 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.

 01:024:059 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.

 01:024:060 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.

 01:024:061 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.

 01:024:062 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.

 01:024:063 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.

 01:024:064 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.

 01:024:065 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.

 01:024:066 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

 01:024:067 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

 01:025:001 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.

 01:025:002 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.

 01:025:003 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

 01:025:004 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.

 01:025:005 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.

 01:025:006 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.

 01:025:007 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.

 01:025:008 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.

 01:025:009 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;

 01:025:010 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

 01:025:011 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.

 01:025:012 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:

 01:025:013 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

 01:025:014 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

 01:025:015 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:

 01:025:016 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.

 01:025:017 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.

 01:025:018 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.

 01:025:019 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:

 01:025:020 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.

 01:025:021 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.

 01:025:022 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.

 01:025:023 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.

 01:025:024 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.

 01:025:025 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.

 01:025:026 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.

 01:025:027 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.

 01:025:028 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.

 01:025:029 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:

 01:025:030 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.

 01:025:031 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.

 01:025:032 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?

 01:025:033 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.

 01:025:034 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.

 01:026:001 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.

 01:026:002 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:

 01:026:003 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;

 01:026:004 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;

 01:026:005 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

 01:026:006 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:

 01:026:007 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.

 01:026:008 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.

 01:026:009 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.

 01:026:010 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.

 01:026:011 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

 01:026:012 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.

 01:026:013 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:

 01:026:014 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.

 01:026:015 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.

 01:026:016 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.

 01:026:017 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.

 01:026:018 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.

 01:026:019 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.

 01:026:020 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.

 01:026:021 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.

 01:026:022 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.

 01:026:023 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.

 01:026:024 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.

 01:026:025 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.

 01:026:026 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.

 01:026:027 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?

 01:026:028 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;

 01:026:029 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.

 01:026:030 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.

 01:026:031 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.

 01:026:032 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.

 01:026:033 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.

 01:026:034 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:

 01:026:035 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

 01:027:001 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.

 01:027:002 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:

 01:027:003 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;

 01:027:004 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.

 01:027:005 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.

 01:027:006 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,

 01:027:007 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.

 01:027:008 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.

 01:027:009 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:

 01:027:010 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.

 01:027:011 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:

 01:027:012 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.

 01:027:013 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.

 01:027:014 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.

 01:027:015 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:

 01:027:016 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:

 01:027:017 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.

 01:027:018 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?

 01:027:019 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.

 01:027:020 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.

 01:027:021 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.

 01:027:022 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.

 01:027:023 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.

 01:027:024 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.

 01:027:025 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.

 01:027:026 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.

 01:027:027 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:

 01:027:028 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:

 01:027:029 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.

 01:027:030 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.

 01:027:031 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.

 01:027:032 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.

 01:027:033 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.

 01:027:034 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.

 01:027:035 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.

 01:027:036 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?

 01:027:037 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?

 01:027:038 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.

 01:027:039 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;

 01:027:040 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.

 01:027:041 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.

 01:027:042 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.

 01:027:043 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;

 01:027:044 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;

 01:027:045 Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?

 01:027:046 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?

 01:028:001 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.

 01:028:002 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy mother's brother.

 01:028:003 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;

 01:028:004 And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.

 01:028:005 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.

 01:028:006 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of Canaan;

 01:028:007 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram;

 01:028:008 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;

 01:028:009 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.

 01:028:010 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.

 01:028:011 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.

 01:028:012 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.

 01:028:013 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;

 01:028:014 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.

 01:028:015 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.

 01:028:016 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.

 01:028:017 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.

 01:028:018 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.

 01:028:019 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.

 01:028:020 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,

 01:028:021 So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:

 01:028:022 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.

 01:029:001 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.

 01:029:002 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.

 01:029:003 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.

 01:029:004 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.

 01:029:005 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.

 01:029:006 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.

 01:029:007 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.

 01:029:008 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.

 01:029:009 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them.

 01:029:010 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.

 01:029:011 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.

 01:029:012 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.

 01:029:013 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.

 01:029:014 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.

 01:029:015 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?

 01:029:016 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.

 01:029:017 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.

 01:029:018 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.

 01:029:019 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.

 01:029:020 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.

 01:029:021 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.

 01:029:022 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.

 01:029:023 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.

 01:029:024 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.

 01:029:025 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?

 01:029:026 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.

 01:029:027 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.

 01:029:028 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.

 01:029:029 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.

 01:029:030 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.

 01:029:031 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.

 01:029:032 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.

 01:029:033 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.

 01:029:034 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.

 01:029:035 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.

 01:030:001 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.

 01:030:002 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?

 01:030:003 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.

 01:030:004 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.

 01:030:005 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.

 01:030:006 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.

 01:030:007 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.

 01:030:008 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.

 01:030:009 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.

 01:030:010 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.

 01:030:011 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.

 01:030:012 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.

 01:030:013 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.

 01:030:014 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.

 01:030:015 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.

 01:030:016 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.

 01:030:017 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.

 01:030:018 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.

 01:030:019 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.

 01:030:020 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.

 01:030:021 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.

 01:030:022 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.

 01:030:023 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:

 01:030:024 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son.

 01:030:025 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.

 01:030:026 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.

 01:030:027 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.

 01:030:028 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.

 01:030:029 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.

 01:030:030 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?

 01:030:031 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.

 01:030:032 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.

 01:030:033 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.

 01:030:034 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.

 01:030:035 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.

 01:030:036 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.

 01:030:037 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.

 01:030:038 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.

 01:030:039 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.

 01:030:040 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle.

 01:030:041 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.

 01:030:042 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.

 01:030:043 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

 01:031:001 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory.

 01:031:002 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.

 01:031:003 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.

 01:031:004 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,

 01:031:005 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.

 01:031:006 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.

 01:031:007 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.

 01:031:008 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.

 01:031:009 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.

 01:031:010 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.

 01:031:011 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.

 01:031:012 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

 01:031:013 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.

 01:031:014 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?

 01:031:015 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.

 01:031:016 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.

 01:031:017 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;

 01:031:018 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.

 01:031:019 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.

 01:031:020 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.

 01:031:021 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.

 01:031:022 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.

 01:031:023 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.

 01:031:024 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

 01:031:025 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.

 01:031:026 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?

 01:031:027 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?

 01:031:028 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.

 01:031:029 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

 01:031:030 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?

 01:031:031 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.

 01:031:032 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.

 01:031:033 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

 01:031:034 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.

 01:031:035 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images.

 01:031:036 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?

 01:031:037 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.

 01:031:038 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.

 01:031:039 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.

 01:031:040 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.

 01:031:041 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.

 01:031:042 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.

 01:031:043 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?

 01:031:044 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.

 01:031:045 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

 01:031:046 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.

 01:031:047 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.

 01:031:048 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;

 01:031:049 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.

 01:031:050 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.

 01:031:051 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:

 01:031:052 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.

 01:031:053 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.

 01:031:054 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.

 01:031:055 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.

 01:032:001 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

 01:032:002 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.

 01:032:003 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.

 01:032:004 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:

 01:032:005 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.

 01:032:006 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.

 01:032:007 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;

 01:032:008 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.

 01:032:009 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:

 01:032:010 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.

 01:032:011 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.

 01:032:012 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.

 01:032:013 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;

 01:032:014 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,

 01:032:015 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.

 01:032:016 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.

 01:032:017 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?

 01:032:018 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.

 01:032:019 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.

 01:032:020 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.

 01:032:021 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.

 01:032:022 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.

 01:032:023 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.

 01:032:024 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.

 01:032:025 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.

 01:032:026 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.

 01:032:027 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.

 01:032:028 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.

 01:032:029 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.

 01:032:030 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.

 01:032:031 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.

 01:032:032 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.

 01:033:001 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.

 01:033:002 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.

 01:033:003 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.

 01:033:004 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.

 01:033:005 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.

 01:033:006 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.

 01:033:007 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.

 01:033:008 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.

 01:033:009 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.

 01:033:010 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.

 01:033:011 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.

 01:033:012 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.

 01:033:013 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.

 01:033:014 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.

 01:033:015 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.

 01:033:016 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.

 01:033:017 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.

 01:033:018 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.

 01:033:019 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.

 01:033:020 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.

 01:034:001 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.

 01:034:002 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.

 01:034:003 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.

 01:034:004 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.

 01:034:005 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.

 01:034:006 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.

 01:034:007 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done.

 01:034:008 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.

 01:034:009 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.

 01:034:010 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.

 01:034:011 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.

 01:034:012 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.

 01:034:013 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:

 01:034:014 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:

 01:034:015 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;

 01:034:016 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.

 01:034:017 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.

 01:034:018 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.

 01:034:019 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.

 01:034:020 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,

 01:034:021 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.

 01:034:022 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.

 01:034:023 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.

 01:034:024 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.

 01:034:025 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.

 01:034:026 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.

 01:034:027 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.

 01:034:028 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,

 01:034:029 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.

 01:034:030 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.

 01:034:031 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?

 01:035:001 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.

 01:035:002 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:

 01:035:003 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.

 01:035:004 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.

 01:035:005 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.

 01:035:006 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.

 01:035:007 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.

 01:035:008 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.

 01:035:009 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.

 01:035:010 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.

 01:035:011 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;

 01:035:012 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

 01:035:013 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.

 01:035:014 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.

 01:035:015 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.

 01:035:016 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.

 01:035:017 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.

 01:035:018 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.

 01:035:019 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.

 01:035:020 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.

 01:035:021 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.

 01:035:022 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:

 01:035:023 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:

 01:035:024 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:

 01:035:025 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:

 01:035:026 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.

 01:035:027 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

 01:035:028 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.

 01:035:029 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.

 01:036:001 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.

 01:036:002 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;

 01:036:003 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.

 01:036:004 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;

 01:036:005 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.

 01:036:006 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.

 01:036:007 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.

 01:036:008 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

 01:036:009 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:

 01:036:010 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.

 01:036:011 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.

 01:036:012 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.

 01:036:013 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.

 01:036:014 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.

 01:036:015 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,

 01:036:016 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.

 01:036:017 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.

 01:036:018 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.

 01:036:019 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes.

 01:036:020 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,

 01:036:021 And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.

 01:036:022 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna.

 01:036:023 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.

 01:036:024 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.

 01:036:025 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.

 01:036:026 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran.

 01:036:027 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.

 01:036:028 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.

 01:036:029 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,

 01:036:030 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.

 01:036:031 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.

 01:036:032 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.

 01:036:033 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.

 01:036:034 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead.

 01:036:035 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.

 01:036:036 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.

 01:036:037 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.

 01:036:038 And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.

 01:036:039 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.

 01:036:040 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,

 01:036:041 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,

 01:036:042 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,

 01:036:043 Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites.

 01:037:001 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.

 01:037:002 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.

 01:037:003 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.

 01:037:004 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.

 01:037:005 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.

 01:037:006 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:

 01:037:007 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.

 01:037:008 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.

 01:037:009 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.

 01:037:010 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?

 01:037:011 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.

 01:037:012 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.

 01:037:013 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.

 01:037:014 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

 01:037:015 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?

 01:037:016 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.

 01:037:017 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.

 01:037:018 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.

 01:037:019 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.

 01:037:020 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.

 01:037:021 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.

 01:037:022 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.

 01:037:023 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;

 01:037:024 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.

 01:037:025 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.

 01:037:026 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?

 01:037:027 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.

 01:037:028 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.

 01:037:029 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.

 01:037:030 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?

 01:037:031 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;

 01:037:032 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.

 01:037:033 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.

 01:037:034 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.

 01:037:035 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.

 01:037:036 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

 01:038:001 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.

 01:038:002 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.

 01:038:003 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.

 01:038:004 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.

 01:038:005 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.

 01:038:006 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.

 01:038:007 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.

 01:038:008 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.

 01:038:009 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.

 01:038:010 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.

 01:038:011 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.

 01:038:012 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

 01:038:013 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.

 01:038:014 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.

 01:038:015 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.

 01:038:016 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?

 01:038:017 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?

 01:038:018 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.

 01:038:019 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.

 01:038:020 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.

 01:038:021 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.

 01:038:022 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.

 01:038:023 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.

 01:038:024 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.

 01:038:025 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.

 01:038:026 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.

 01:038:027 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.

 01:038:028 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.

 01:038:029 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.

 01:038:030 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.

 01:039:001 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.

 01:039:002 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.

 01:039:003 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

 01:039:004 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.

 01:039:005 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.

 01:039:006 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.

 01:039:007 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.

 01:039:008 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;

 01:039:009 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?

 01:039:010 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.

 01:039:011 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.

 01:039:012 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.

 01:039:013 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,

 01:039:014 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:

 01:039:015 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.

 01:039:016 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.

 01:039:017 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:

 01:039:018 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.

 01:039:019 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.

 01:039:020 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.

 01:039:021 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

 01:039:022 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.

 01:039:023 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.

 01:040:001 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.

 01:040:002 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.

 01:040:003 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.

 01:040:004 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.

 01:040:005 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.

 01:040:006 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.

 01:040:007 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?

 01:040:008 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.

 01:040:009 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;

 01:040:010 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:

 01:040:011 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.

 01:040:012 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:

 01:040:013 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.

 01:040:014 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:

 01:040:015 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.

 01:040:016 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:

 01:040:017 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.

 01:040:018 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:

 01:040:019 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.

 01:040:020 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.

 01:040:021 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:

 01:040:022 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.

 01:040:023 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

 01:041:001 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.

 01:041:002 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.

 01:041:003 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.

 01:041:004 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.

 01:041:005 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

 01:041:006 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.

 01:041:007 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.

 01:041:008 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.

 01:041:009 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:

 01:041:010 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:

 01:041:011 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.

 01:041:012 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.

 01:041:013 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.

 01:041:014 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.

 01:041:015 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.

 01:041:016 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

 01:041:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:

 01:041:018 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:

 01:041:019 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:

 01:041:020 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:

 01:041:021 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.

 01:041:022 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:

 01:041:023 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:

 01:041:024 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.

 01:041:025 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.

 01:041:026 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.

 01:041:027 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.

 01:041:028 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.

 01:041:029 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:

 01:041:030 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;

 01:041:031 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.

 01:041:032 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.

 01:041:033 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.

 01:041:034 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.

 01:041:035 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.

 01:041:036 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.

 01:041:037 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.

 01:041:038 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?

 01:041:039 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:

 01:041:040 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.

 01:041:041 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.

 01:041:042 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;

 01:041:043 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.

 01:041:044 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.

 01:041:045 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.

 01:041:046 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

 01:041:047 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.

 01:041:048 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.

 01:041:049 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.

 01:041:050 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.

 01:041:051 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.

 01:041:052 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

 01:041:053 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.

 01:041:054 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.

 01:041:055 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.

 01:041:056 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.

 01:041:057 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.

 01:042:001 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?

 01:042:002 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.

 01:042:003 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

 01:042:004 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.

 01:042:005 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

 01:042:006 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.

 01:042:007 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.

 01:042:008 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.

 01:042:009 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.

 01:042:010 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.

 01:042:011 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.

 01:042:012 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.

 01:042:013 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.

 01:042:014 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:

 01:042:015 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

 01:042:016 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.

 01:042:017 And he put them all together into ward three days.

 01:042:018 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:

 01:042:019 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:

 01:042:020 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

 01:042:021 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.

 01:042:022 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.

 01:042:023 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.

 01:042:024 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.

 01:042:025 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.

 01:042:026 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.

 01:042:027 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.

 01:042:028 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?

 01:042:029 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,

 01:042:030 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.

 01:042:031 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:

 01:042:032 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

 01:042:033 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:

 01:042:034 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.

 01:042:035 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.

 01:042:036 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.

 01:042:037 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.

 01:042:038 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

 01:043:001 And the famine was sore in the land.

 01:043:002 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.

 01:043:003 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.

 01:043:004 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:

 01:043:005 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.

 01:043:006 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?

 01:043:007 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?

 01:043:008 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.

 01:043:009 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:

 01:043:010 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.

 01:043:011 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:

 01:043:012 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:

 01:043:013 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:

 01:043:014 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.

 01:043:015 And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.

 01:043:016 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.

 01:043:017 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.

 01:043:018 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.

 01:043:019 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,

 01:043:020 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:

 01:043:021 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.

 01:043:022 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.

 01:043:023 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.

 01:043:024 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.

 01:043:025 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.

 01:043:026 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.

 01:043:027 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?

 01:043:028 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.

 01:043:029 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.

 01:043:030 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.

 01:043:031 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.

 01:043:032 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.

 01:043:033 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.

 01:043:034 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And they drank, and were merry with him.

 01:044:001 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.

 01:044:002 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.

 01:044:003 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.

 01:044:004 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?

 01:044:005 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

 01:044:006 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.

 01:044:007 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:

 01:044:008 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?

 01:044:009 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.

 01:044:010 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.

 01:044:011 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.

 01:044:012 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

 01:044:013 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.

 01:044:014 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.

 01:044:015 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?

 01:044:016 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.

 01:044:017 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.

 01:044:018 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.

 01:044:019 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?

 01:044:020 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.

 01:044:021 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.

 01:044:022 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.

 01:044:023 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.

 01:044:024 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.

 01:044:025 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.

 01:044:026 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.

 01:044:027 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:

 01:044:028 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:

 01:044:029 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

 01:044:030 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;

 01:044:031 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.

 01:044:032 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.

 01:044:033 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.

 01:044:034 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.

 01:045:001 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.

 01:045:002 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.

 01:045:003 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.

 01:045:004 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.

 01:045:005 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.

 01:045:006 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.

 01:045:007 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

 01:045:008 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.

 01:045:009 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:

 01:045:010 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:

 01:045:011 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.

 01:045:012 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.

 01:045:013 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.

 01:045:014 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.

 01:045:015 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.

 01:045:016 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.

 01:045:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;

 01:045:018 And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.

 01:045:019 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.

 01:045:020 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is your's.

 01:045:021 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.

 01:045:022 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.

 01:045:023 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.

 01:045:024 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.

 01:045:025 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,

 01:045:026 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.

 01:045:027 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:

 01:045:028 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.

 01:046:001 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.

 01:046:002 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.

 01:046:003 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:

 01:046:004 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.

 01:046:005 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

 01:046:006 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:

 01:046:007 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.

 01:046:008 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.

 01:046:009 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.

 01:046:010 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.

 01:046:011 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

 01:046:012 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.

 01:046:013 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.

 01:046:014 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.

 01:046:015 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.

 01:046:016 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.

 01:046:017 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.

 01:046:018 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.

 01:046:019 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.

 01:046:020 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.

 01:046:021 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.

 01:046:022 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.

 01:046:023 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.

 01:046:024 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.

 01:046:025 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.

 01:046:026 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;

 01:046:027 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.

 01:046:028 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.

 01:046:029 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

 01:046:030 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.

 01:046:031 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;

 01:046:032 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.

 01:046:033 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?

 01:046:034 That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.

 01:047:001 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.

 01:047:002 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.

 01:047:003 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.

 01:047:004 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.

 01:047:005 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:

 01:047:006 The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.

 01:047:007 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

 01:047:008 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?

 01:047:009 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.

 01:047:010 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.

 01:047:011 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

 01:047:012 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.

 01:047:013 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.

 01:047:014 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.

 01:047:015 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.

 01:047:016 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.

 01:047:017 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.

 01:047:018 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:

 01:047:019 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.

 01:047:020 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.

 01:047:021 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.

 01:047:022 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.

 01:047:023 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.

 01:047:024 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.

 01:047:025 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.

 01:047:026 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.

 01:047:027 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.

 01:047:028 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.

 01:047:029 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:

 01:047:030 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.

 01:047:031 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.

 01:048:001 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.

 01:048:002 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.

 01:048:003 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,

 01:048:004 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.

 01:048:005 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.

 01:048:006 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.

 01:048:007 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.

 01:048:008 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?

 01:048:009 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.

 01:048:010 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.

 01:048:011 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.

 01:048:012 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.

 01:048:013 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.

 01:048:014 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.

 01:048:015 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,

 01:048:016 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.

 01:048:017 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.

 01:048:018 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.

 01:048:019 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.

 01:048:020 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.

 01:048:021 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.

 01:048:022 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.

 01:049:001 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.

 01:049:002 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.

 01:049:003 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:

 01:049:004 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.

 01:049:005 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.

 01:049:006 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.

 01:049:007 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.

 01:049:008 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.

 01:049:009 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?

 01:049:010 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.

 01:049:011 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:

 01:049:012 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.

 01:049:013 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.

 01:049:014 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:

 01:049:015 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.

 01:049:016 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

 01:049:017 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.

 01:049:018 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.

 01:049:019 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.

 01:049:020 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.

 01:049:021 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.

 01:049:022 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:

 01:049:023 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:

 01:049:024 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)

 01:049:025 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:

 01:049:026 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.

 01:049:027 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.

 01:049:028 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.

 01:049:029 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,

 01:049:030 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.

 01:049:031 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.

 01:049:032 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.

 01:049:033 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.

 01:050:001 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.

 01:050:002 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.

 01:050:003 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.

 01:050:004 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,

 01:050:005 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.

 01:050:006 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.

 01:050:007 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,

 01:050:008 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.

 01:050:009 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.

 01:050:010 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.

 01:050:011 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.

 01:050:012 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:

 01:050:013 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

 01:050:014 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.

 01:050:015 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.

 01:050:016 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,

 01:050:017 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.

 01:050:018 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.

 01:050:019 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?

 01:050:020 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.

 01:050:021 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.

 01:050:022 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.

 01:050:023 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.

 01:050:024 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

 01:050:025 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.

 01:050:026 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

 Book 02 Exodus

 02:001:001 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.

 02:001:002 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

 02:001:003 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

 02:001:004 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

 02:001:005 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.

 02:001:006 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.

 02:001:007 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.

 02:001:008 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.

 02:001:009 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:

 02:001:010 Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.

 02:001:011 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.

 02:001:012 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.

 02:001:013 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:

 02:001:014 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.

 02:001:015 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:

 02:001:016 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.

 02:001:017 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.

 02:001:018 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?

 02:001:019 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.

 02:001:020 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.

 02:001:021 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.

 02:001:022 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

 02:002:001 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.

 02:002:002 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.

 02:002:003 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.

 02:002:004 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.

 02:002:005 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.

 02:002:006 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.

 02:002:007 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?

 02:002:008 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.

 02:002:009 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it.

 02:002:010 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.

 02:002:011 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.

 02:002:012 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.

 02:002:013 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?

 02:002:014 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.

 02:002:015 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.

 02:002:016 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.

 02:002:017 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.

 02:002:018 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?

 02:002:019 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.

 02:002:020 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

 02:002:021 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.

 02:002:022 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.

 02:002:023 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.

 02:002:024 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

 02:002:025 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.

 02:003:001 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.

 02:003:002 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.

 02:003:003 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.

 02:003:004 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.

 02:003:005 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

 02:003:006 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.

 02:003:007 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;

 02:003:008 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

 02:003:009 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.

 02:003:010 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.

 02:003:011 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?

 02:003:012 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

 02:003:013 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?

 02:003:014 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.

 02:003:015 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.

 02:003:016 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:

 02:003:017 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

 02:003:018 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.

 02:003:019 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.

 02:003:020 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.

 02:003:021 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.

 02:003:022 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

 02:004:001 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.

 02:004:002 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.

 02:004:003 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.

 02:004:004 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:

 02:004:005 That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.

 02:004:006 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.

 02:004:007 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.

 02:004:008 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.

 02:004:009 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.

 02:004:010 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.

 02:004:011 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?

 02:004:012 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.

 02:004:013 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.

 02:004:014 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.

 02:004:015 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.

 02:004:016 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.

 02:004:017 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.

 02:004:018 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.

 02:004:019 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.

 02:004:020 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.

 02:004:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.

 02:004:022 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:

 02:004:023 And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.

 02:004:024 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.

 02:004:025 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.

 02:004:026 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.

 02:004:027 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.

 02:004:028 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.

 02:004:029 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:

 02:004:030 And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.

 02:004:031 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

 02:005:001 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.

 02:005:002 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.

 02:005:003 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.

 02:005:004 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.

 02:005:005 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.

 02:005:006 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,

 02:005:007 Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.

 02:005:008 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.

 02:005:009 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.

 02:005:010 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.

 02:005:011 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.

 02:005:012 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.

 02:005:013 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.

 02:005:014 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?

 02:005:015 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?

 02:005:016 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.

 02:005:017 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.

 02:005:018 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.

 02:005:019 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.

 02:005:020 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:

 02:005:021 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.

 02:005:022 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?

 02:005:023 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

 02:006:001 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.

 02:006:002 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD:

 02:006:003 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.

 02:006:004 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.

 02:006:005 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.

 02:006:006 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:

 02:006:007 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

 02:006:008 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.

 02:006:009 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.

 02:006:010 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 02:006:011 Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.

 02:006:012 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?

 02:006:013 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

 02:006:014 These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the families of Reuben.

 02:006:015 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon.

 02:006:016 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.

 02:006:017 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.

 02:006:018 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years.

 02:006:019 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi according to their generations.

 02:006:020 And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.

 02:006:021 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

 02:006:022 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.

 02:006:023 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

 02:006:024 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites.

 02:006:025 And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.

 02:006:026 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.

 02:006:027 These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.

 02:006:028 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt,

 02:006:029 That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.

 02:006:030 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

 02:007:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.

 02:007:002 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.

 02:007:003 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.

 02:007:004 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.

 02:007:005 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.

 02:007:006 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.

 02:007:007 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.

 02:007:008 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

 02:007:009 When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.

 02:007:010 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.

 02:007:011 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.

 02:007:012 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

 02:007:013 And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

 02:007:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go.

 02:007:015 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.

 02:007:016 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.

 02:007:017 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.

 02:007:018 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.

 02:007:019 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.

 02:007:020 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.

 02:007:021 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

 02:007:022 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.

 02:007:023 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.

 02:007:024 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.

 02:007:025 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.

 02:008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

 02:008:002 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:

 02:008:003 And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:

 02:008:004 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.

 02:008:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.

 02:008:006 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.

 02:008:007 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

 02:008:008 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.

 02:008:009 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?

 02:008:010 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God.

 02:008:011 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.

 02:008:012 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.

 02:008:013 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.

 02:008:014 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.

 02:008:015 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

 02:008:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

 02:008:017 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

 02:008:018 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.

 02:008:019 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

 02:008:020 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

 02:008:021 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.

 02:008:022 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.

 02:008:023 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.

 02:008:024 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.

 02:008:025 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.

 02:008:026 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?

 02:008:027 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.

 02:008:028 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me.

 02:008:029 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.

 02:008:030 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

 02:008:031 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.

 02:008:032 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.

 02:009:001 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

 02:009:002 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,

 02:009:003 Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.

 02:009:004 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel.

 02:009:005 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.

 02:009:006 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.

 02:009:007 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.

 02:009:008 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.

 02:009:009 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.

 02:009:010 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.

 02:009:011 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.

 02:009:012 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.

 02:009:013 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

 02:009:014 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.

 02:009:015 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.

 02:009:016 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.

 02:009:017 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?

 02:009:018 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.

 02:009:019 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.

 02:009:020 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:

 02:009:021 And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.

 02:009:022 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.

 02:009:023 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

 02:009:024 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.

 02:009:025 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.

 02:009:026 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.

 02:009:027 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.

 02:009:028 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.

 02:009:029 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's.

 02:009:030 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.

 02:009:031 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.

 02:009:032 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up.

 02:009:033 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.

 02:009:034 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.

 02:009:035 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.

 02:010:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him:

 02:010:002 And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD.

 02:010:003 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.

 02:010:004 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:

 02:010:005 And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:

 02:010:006 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.

 02:010:007 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?

 02:010:008 And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?

 02:010:009 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.

 02:010:010 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.

 02:010:011 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.

 02:010:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.

 02:010:013 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.

 02:010:014 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.

 02:010:015 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.

 02:010:016 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.

 02:010:017 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.

 02:010:018 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

 02:010:019 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.

 02:010:020 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.

 02:010:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.

 02:010:022 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:

 02:010:023 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.

 02:010:024 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.

 02:010:025 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.

 02:010:026 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.

 02:010:027 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.

 02:010:028 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.

 02:010:029 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.

 02:011:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.

 02:011:002 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and jewels of gold.

 02:011:003 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.

 02:011:004 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:

 02:011:005 And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.

 02:011:006 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.

 02:011:007 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.

 02:011:008 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.

 02:011:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

 02:011:010 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.

 02:012:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying,

 02:012:002 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.

 02:012:003 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:

 02:012:004 And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.

 02:012:005 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:

 02:012:006 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.

 02:012:007 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.

 02:012:008 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

 02:012:009 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.

 02:012:010 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.

 02:012:011 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD's passover.

 02:012:012 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.

 02:012:013 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.

 02:012:014 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.

 02:012:015 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.

 02:012:016 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.

 02:012:017 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.

 02:012:018 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.

 02:012:019 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.

 02:012:020 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.

 02:012:021 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.

 02:012:022 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.

 02:012:023 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.

 02:012:024 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.

 02:012:025 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.

 02:012:026 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?

 02:012:027 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.

 02:012:028 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

 02:012:029 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.

 02:012:030 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.

 02:012:031 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.

 02:012:032 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.

 02:012:033 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.

 02:012:034 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.

 02:012:035 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:

 02:012:036 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.

 02:012:037 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.

 02:012:038 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.

 02:012:039 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.

 02:012:040 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.

 02:012:041 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.

 02:012:042 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.

 02:012:043 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:

 02:012:044 But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.

 02:012:045 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.

 02:012:046 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.

 02:012:047 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

 02:012:048 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.

 02:012:049 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.

 02:012:050 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

 02:012:051 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.

 02:013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 02:013:002 Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.

 02:013:003 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.

 02:013:004 This day came ye out in the month Abib.

 02:013:005 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.

 02:013:006 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD.

 02:013:007 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.

 02:013:008 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.

 02:013:009 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.

 02:013:010 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.

 02:013:011 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,

 02:013:012 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the LORD's.

 02:013:013 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.

 02:013:014 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:

 02:013:015 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.

 02:013:016 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.

 02:013:017 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:

 02:013:018 But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.

 02:013:019 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.

 02:013:020 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.

 02:013:021 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:

 02:013:022 He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.

 02:014:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 02:014:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.

 02:014:003 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.

 02:014:004 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.

 02:014:005 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?

 02:014:006 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:

 02:014:007 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

 02:014:008 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.

 02:014:009 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.

 02:014:010 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.

 02:014:011 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?

 02:014:012 Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.

 02:014:013 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.

 02:014:014 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

 02:014:015 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:

 02:014:016 But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.

 02:014:017 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

 02:014:018 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

 02:014:019 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:

 02:014:020 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.

 02:014:021 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

 02:014:022 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.

 02:014:023 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.

 02:014:024 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,

 02:014:025 And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.

 02:014:026 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.

 02:014:027 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.

 02:014:028 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.

 02:014:029 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.

 02:014:030 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.

 02:014:031 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.

 02:015:001 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

 02:015:002 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.

 02:015:003 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.

 02:015:004 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

 02:015:005 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.

 02:015:006 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

 02:015:007 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.

 02:015:008 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.

 02:015:009 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.

 02:015:010 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.

 02:015:011 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

 02:015:012 Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

 02:015:013 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.

 02:015:014 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.

 02:015:015 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.

 02:015:016 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.

 02:015:017 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have established.

 02:015:018 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.

 02:015:019 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.

 02:015:020 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.

 02:015:021 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

 02:015:022 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.

 02:015:023 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.

 02:015:024 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?

 02:015:025 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,

 02:015:026 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.

 02:015:027 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.

 02:016:001 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.

 02:016:002 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:

 02:016:003 And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

 02:016:004 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.

 02:016:005 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.

 02:016:006 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:

 02:016:007 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?

 02:016:008 And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.

 02:016:009 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.

 02:016:010 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.

 02:016:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 02:016:012 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.

 02:016:013 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.

 02:016:014 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.

 02:016:015 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.

 02:016:016 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.

 02:016:017 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.

 02:016:018 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.

 02:016:019 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

 02:016:020 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.

 02:016:021 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

 02:016:022 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.

 02:016:023 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.

 02:016:024 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.

 02:016:025 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.

 02:016:026 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.

 02:016:027 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.

 02:016:028 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?

 02:016:029 See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.

 02:016:030 So the people rested on the seventh day.

 02:016:031 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.

 02:016:032 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.

 02:016:033 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.

 02:016:034 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.

 02:016:035 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.

 02:016:036 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

 02:017:001 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.

 02:017:002 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?

 02:017:003 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?

 02:017:004 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.

 02:017:005 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.

 02:017:006 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.

 02:017:007 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?

 02:017:008 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

 02:017:009 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.

 02:017:010 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.

 02:017:011 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

 02:017:012 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.

 02:017:013 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.

 02:017:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

 02:017:015 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:

 02:017:016 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

 02:018:001 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;

 02:018:002 Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,

 02:018:003 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:

 02:018:004 And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:

 02:018:005 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:

 02:018:006 And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.

 02:018:007 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.

 02:018:008 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.

 02:018:009 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.

 02:018:010 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

 02:018:011 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.

 02:018:012 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.

 02:018:013 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.

 02:018:014 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?

 02:018:015 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:

 02:018:016 When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.

 02:018:017 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.

 02:018:018 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.

 02:018:019 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:

 02:018:020 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.

 02:018:021 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:

 02:018:022 And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.

 02:018:023 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.

 02:018:024 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.

 02:018:025 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

 02:018:026 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.

 02:018:027 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.

 02:019:001 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.

 02:019:002 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.

 02:019:003 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;

 02:019:004 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.

 02:019:005 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:

 02:019:006 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.

 02:019:007 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.

 02:019:008 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.

 02:019:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.

 02:019:010 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,

 02:019:011 And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.

 02:019:012 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:

 02:019:013 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.

 02:019:014 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.

 02:019:015 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.

 02:019:016 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.

 02:019:017 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.

 02:019:018 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

 02:019:019 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.

 02:019:020 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.

 02:019:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.

 02:019:022 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.

 02:019:023 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.

 02:019:024 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.

 02:019:025 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

 02:020:001 And God spake all these words, saying,

 02:020:002 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

 02:020:003 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

 02:020:004 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

 02:020:005 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;

 02:020:006 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

 02:020:007 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

 02:020:008 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

 02:020:009 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

 02:020:010 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:

 02:020:011 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

 02:020:012 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

 02:020:013 Thou shalt not kill.

 02:020:014 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

 02:020:015 Thou shalt not steal.

 02:020:016 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

 02:020:017 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

 02:020:018 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.

 02:020:019 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.

 02:020:020 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.

 02:020:021 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.

 02:020:022 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.

 02:020:023 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.

 02:020:024 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.

 02:020:025 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.

 02:020:026 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.

 02:021:001 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.

 02:021:002 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

 02:021:003 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.

 02:021:004 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.

 02:021:005 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:

 02:021:006 Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.

 02:021:007 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.

 02:021:008 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.

 02:021:009 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.

 02:021:010 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.

 02:021:011 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.

 02:021:012 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.

 02:021:013 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.

 02:021:014 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.

 02:021:015 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.

 02:021:016 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

 02:021:017 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.

 02:021:018 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:

 02:021:019 If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.

 02:021:020 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.

 02:021:021 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.

 02:021:022 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.

 02:021:023 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,

 02:021:024 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

 02:021:025 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

 02:021:026 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.

 02:021:027 And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.

 02:021:028 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.

 02:021:029 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.

 02:021:030 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.

 02:021:031 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.

 02:021:032 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.

 02:021:033 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;

 02:021:034 The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.

 02:021:035 And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide.

 02:021:036 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.

 02:022:001 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.

 02:022:002 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him.

 02:022:003 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.

 02:022:004 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.

 02:022:005 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.

 02:022:006 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.

 02:022:007 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.

 02:022:008 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods.

 02:022:009 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.

 02:022:010 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:

 02:022:011 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.

 02:022:012 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.

 02:022:013 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn.

 02:022:014 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good.

 02:022:015 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.

 02:022:016 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.

 02:022:017 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.

 02:022:018 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

 02:022:019 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.

 02:022:020 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.

 02:022:021 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

 02:022:022 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.

 02:022:023 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;

 02:022:024 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.

 02:022:025 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.

 02:022:026 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:

 02:022:027 For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.

 02:022:028 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.

 02:022:029 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.

 02:022:030 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.

 02:022:031 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.

 02:023:001 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.

 02:023:002 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:

 02:023:003 Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.

 02:023:004 If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.

 02:023:005 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.

 02:023:006 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.

 02:023:007 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.

 02:023:008 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.

 02:023:009 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

 02:023:010 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:

 02:023:011 But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.

 02:023:012 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

 02:023:013 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.

 02:023:014 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.

 02:023:015 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)

 02:023:016 And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.

 02:023:017 Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the LORD God.

 02:023:018 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.

 02:023:019 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.

 02:023:020 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

 02:023:021 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.

 02:023:022 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.

 02:023:023 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.

 02:023:024 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.

 02:023:025 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.

 02:023:026 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.

 02:023:027 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.

 02:023:028 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.

 02:023:029 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.

 02:023:030 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.

 02:023:031 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.

 02:023:032 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

 02:023:033 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.

 02:024:001 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off.

 02:024:002 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.

 02:024:003 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do.

 02:024:004 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

 02:024:005 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD.

 02:024:006 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

 02:024:007 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient.

 02:024:008 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words.

 02:024:009 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:

 02:024:010 And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.

 02:024:011 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.

 02:024:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.

 02:024:013 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.

 02:024:014 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.

 02:024:015 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.

 02:024:016 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.

 02:024:017 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.

 02:024:018 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.

 02:025:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 02:025:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.

 02:025:003 And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass,

 02:025:004 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,

 02:025:005 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,

 02:025:006 Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense,

 02:025:007 Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate.

 02:025:008 And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.

 02:025:009 According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.

 02:025:010 And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

 02:025:011 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.

 02:025:012 And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.

 02:025:013 And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.

 02:025:014 And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.

 02:025:015 The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it.

 02:025:016 And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.

 02:025:017 And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.

 02:025:018 And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.

 02:025:019 And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof.

 02:025:020 And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.

 02:025:021 And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.

 02:025:022 And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.

 02:025:023 Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

 02:025:024 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.

 02:025:025 And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.

 02:025:026 And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.

 02:025:027 Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table.

 02:025:028 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.

 02:025:029 And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of pure gold shalt thou make them.

 02:025:030 And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.

 02:025:031 And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.

 02:025:032 And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side:

 02:025:033 Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick.

 02:025:034 And in the candlesticks shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers.

 02:025:035 And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick.

 02:025:036 Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold.

 02:025:037 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.

 02:025:038 And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold.

 02:025:039 Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels.

 02:025:040 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount.

 02:026:001 Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them.

 02:029:001 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish,

 02:029:002 And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shalt thou make them.

 02:029:003 And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.

 02:029:008 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.

 02:029:009 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons.

 02:029:010 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock.

 02:029:011 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 02:029:012 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.

 02:029:013 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.

 02:029:014 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering.

 02:029:015 Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.

 02:029:016 And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.

 02:029:017 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his head.

 02:029:018 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

 02:029:019 And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.

 02:029:020 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.

 02:029:021 And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.

 02:029:022 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:

 02:029:023 And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD:

 02:029:024 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.

 02:029:025 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

 02:029:026 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy part.

 02:029:027 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:

 02:029:028 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD.

 02:029:029 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.

 02:029:030 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place.

 02:029:031 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place.

 02:029:032 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 02:029:033 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.

 02:029:034 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.

 02:029:035 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.

 02:029:036 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.

 02:029:037 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.

 02:029:038 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.

 02:029:039 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:

 02:029:040 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.

 02:029:041 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

 02:029:042 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.

 02:029:043 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.

 02:029:044 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office.

 02:029:045 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.

 02:029:046 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their God.

 02:030:001 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood shalt thou make it.

 02:030:002 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.

 02:030:003 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.

 02:030:004 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.

 02:030:005 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.

 02:030:006 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.

 02:030:007 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.

 02:030:008 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.

 02:030:009 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.

 02:030:010 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.

 02:030:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 02:030:012 When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them.

 02:030:013 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.

 02:030:014 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.

 02:030:015 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.

 02:030:016 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.

 02:030:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 02:030:018 Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.

 02:030:019 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:

 02:030:020 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:

 02:030:021 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.

 02:030:022 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 02:030:023 Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,

 02:030:024 And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:

 02:030:025 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.

 02:030:026 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,

 02:030:027 And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense,

 02:030:028 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot.

 02:030:029 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.

 02:030:030 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

 02:030:031 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.

 02:030:032 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you.

 02:030:033 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.

 02:030:034 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight:

 02:030:035 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:

 02:030:036 And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.

 02:030:037 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.

 02:030:038 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.

 02:031:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 02:031:002 See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:

 02:031:003 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,

 02:031:004 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,

 02:031:005 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.

 02:031:006 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;

 02:031:007 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,

 02:031:008 And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,

 02:031:009 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,

 02:031:010 And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,

 02:031:011 And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.

 02:031:012 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 02:031:013 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.

 02:031:014 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

 02:031:015 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.

 02:031:016 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.

 02:031:017 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.

 02:031:018 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.

 02:032:001 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

 02:032:002 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.

 02:032:003 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.

 02:032:004 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

 02:032:005 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.

 02:032:006 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.

 02:032:007 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:

 02:032:008 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

 02:032:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:

 02:032:010 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.

 02:032:011 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?

 02:032:012 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.

 02:032:013 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.

 02:032:014 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.

 02:032:015 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.

 02:032:016 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.

 02:032:017 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.

 02:032:018 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.

 02:032:019 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.

 02:032:020 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.

 02:032:021 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?

 02:032:022 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.

 02:032:023 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

 02:032:024 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.

 02:032:025 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)

 02:032:026 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.

 02:032:027 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.

 02:032:028 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.

 02:032:029 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.

 02:032:030 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.

 02:032:031 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.

 02:032:032 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.

 02:032:033 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.

 02:032:034 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.

 02:032:035 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.

 02:033:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:

 02:033:002 And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:

 02:033:003 Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.

 02:033:004 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.

 02:033:005 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.

 02:033:006 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.

 02:033:007 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.

 02:033:008 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.

 02:033:009 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.

 02:033:010 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.

 02:033:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.

 02:033:012 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.

 02:033:013 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.

 02:033:014 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.

 02:033:015 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.

 02:033:016 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.

 02:033:017 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.

 02:033:018 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.

 02:033:019 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.

 02:033:020 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.

 02:033:021 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:

 02:033:022 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:

 02:033:023 And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.

 02:034:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.

 02:034:002 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.

 02:034:003 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.

 02:034:004 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.

 02:034:005 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.

 02:034:006 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,

 02:034:007 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.

 02:034:008 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.

 02:034:009 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.

 02:034:010 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.

 02:034:011 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

 02:034:012 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:

 02:034:013 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:

 02:034:014 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:

 02:034:015 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;

 02:034:016 And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.

 02:034:017 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.

 02:034:018 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.

 02:034:019 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.

 02:034:020 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.

 02:034:021 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.

 02:034:022 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.

 02:034:023 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.

 02:034:024 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.

 02:034:025 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.

 02:034:026 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.

 02:034:027 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.

 02:034:028 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

 02:034:029 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.

 02:034:030 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.

 02:034:031 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.

 02:034:032 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.

 02:034:033 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.

 02:034:034 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.

 02:034:035 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

 02:035:001 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them.

 02:035:002 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.

 02:035:003 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.

 02:035:004 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,

 02:035:005 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass,

 02:035:006 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,

 02:035:007 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,

 02:035:008 And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,

 02:035:009 And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.

 02:035:010 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded;

 02:035:011 The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,

 02:035:012 The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the vail of the covering,

 02:035:013 The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the shewbread,

 02:035:014 The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light,

 02:035:015 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle,

 02:035:016 The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,

 02:035:017 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court,

 02:035:018 The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,

 02:035:019 The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.

 02:035:020 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.

 02:035:021 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments.

 02:035:022 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the LORD.

 02:035:023 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.

 02:035:024 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.

 02:035:025 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.

 02:035:026 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats' hair.

 02:035:027 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;

 02:035:028 And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.

 02:035:029 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.

 02:035:030 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;

 02:035:031 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;

 02:035:032 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,

 02:035:033 And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.

 02:035:034 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

 02:035:035 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.

 02:036:001 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded.

 02:036:002 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:

 02:036:003 And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.

 02:036:004 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;

 02:036:005 And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.

 02:036:006 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.

 02:036:007 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.

 02:036:008 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.

 02:036:009 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.

 02:036:010 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another.

 02:036:011 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.

 02:036:012 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another.

 02:036:013 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.

 02:036:014 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.

 02:036:015 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.

 02:036:016 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.

 02:036:017 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.

 02:036:018 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.

 02:036:019 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that.

 02:036:020 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up.

 02:036:021 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.

 02:036:022 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

 02:036:023 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward:

 02:036:024 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.

 02:036:025 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards,

 02:036:026 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.

 02:036:027 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.

 02:036:028 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.

 02:036:029 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.

 02:036:030 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.

 02:036:031 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,

 02:036:032 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.

 02:036:033 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.

 02:036:034 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.

 02:036:035 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.

 02:036:036 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver.

 02:036:037 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;

 02:036:038 And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass.

 02:037:001 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:

 02:037:002 And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.

 02:037:003 And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it.

 02:037:004 And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.

 02:037:005 And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.

 02:037:006 And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof.

 02:037:007 And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;

 02:037:008 One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof.

 02:037:009 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims.

 02:037:010 And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof:

 02:037:011 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about.

 02:037:012 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.

 02:037:013 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof.

 02:037:014 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.

 02:037:015 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.

 02:037:016 And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of pure gold.

 02:037:017 And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same:

 02:037:018 And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:

 02:037:019 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick.

 02:037:020 And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers:

 02:037:021 And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.

 02:037:022 Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was one beaten work of pure gold.

 02:037:023 And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes, of pure gold.

 02:037:024 Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.

 02:037:025 And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same.

 02:037:026 And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown of gold round about.

 02:037:027 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it withal.

 02:037:028 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.

 02:037:029 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.

 02:038:001 And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it was foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.

 02:038:002 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.

 02:038:003 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof made he of brass.

 02:038:004 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.

 02:038:005 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for the staves.

 02:038:006 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass.

 02:038:007 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards.

 02:038:008 And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 02:038:009 And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred cubits:

 02:038:010 Their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.

 02:038:011 And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits, their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.

 02:038:012 And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.

 02:038:013 And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.

 02:038:014 The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.

 02:038:015 And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.

 02:038:016 All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen.

 02:038:017 And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver.

 02:038:018 And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.

 02:038:019 And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets of silver.

 02:038:020 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass.

 02:038:021 This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest.

 02:038:022 And Bezaleel the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.

 02:038:023 And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.

 02:038:024 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

 02:038:025 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:

 02:038:026 A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.

 02:038:027 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.

 02:038:028 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted them.

 02:038:029 And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.

 02:038:030 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,

 02:038:031 And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.

 02:039:001 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 02:039:002 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

 02:039:003 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work.

 02:039:004 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together.

 02:039:005 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 02:039:006 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.

 02:039:007 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 02:039:008 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

 02:039:009 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.

 02:039:010 And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.

 02:039:011 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

 02:039:012 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

 02:039:013 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.

 02:039:014 And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.

 02:039:015 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold.

 02:039:016 And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.

 02:039:017 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate.

 02:039:018 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it.

 02:039:019 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward.

 02:039:020 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.

 02:039:021 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 02:039:022 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.

 02:039:023 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.

 02:039:024 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.

 02:039:025 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;

 02:039:026 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 02:039:027 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,

 02:039:028 And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,

 02:039:029 And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 02:039:030 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

 02:039:031 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 02:039:032 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.

 02:039:033 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets,

 02:039:034 And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,

 02:039:035 The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,

 02:039:036 The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,

 02:039:037 The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,

 02:039:038 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,

 02:039:039 The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,

 02:039:040 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation,

 02:039:041 The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.

 02:039:042 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work.

 02:039:043 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.

 02:040:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 02:040:002 On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

 02:040:003 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.

 02:040:004 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.

 02:040:005 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.

 02:040:006 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

 02:040:007 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.

 02:040:008 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.

 02:040:009 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.

 02:040:010 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.

 02:040:011 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.

 02:040:012 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

 02:040:013 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.

 02:040:014 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:

 02:040:015 And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.

 02:040:016 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.

 02:040:017 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.

 02:040:018 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.

 02:040:019 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 02:040:020 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:

 02:040:021 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 02:040:022 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.

 02:040:023 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.

 02:040:024 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.

 02:040:025 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 02:040:026 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:

 02:040:027 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 02:040:028 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.

 02:040:029 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 02:040:030 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.

 02:040:031 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:

 02:040:032 When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 02:040:033 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.

 02:040:034 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

 02:040:035 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

 02:040:036 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:

 02:040:037 But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.

 02:040:038 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.

 Book 03 Leviticus

 03:001:001 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

 03:001:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock.

 03:001:003 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.

 03:001:004 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

 03:001:005 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 03:001:006 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.

 03:001:007 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:

 03:001:008 And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:

 03:001:009 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 03:001:010 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.

 03:001:011 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar.

 03:001:012 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:

 03:001:013 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 03:001:014 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.

 03:001:015 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:

 03:001:016 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:

 03:001:017 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 03:002:001 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:

 03:002:002 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:

 03:002:003 And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.

 03:002:004 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.

 03:002:005 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.

 03:002:006 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat offering.

 03:002:007 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.

 03:002:008 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.

 03:002:009 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 03:002:010 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.

 03:002:011 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire.

 03:002:012 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.

 03:002:013 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.

 03:002:014 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.

 03:002:015 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meat offering.

 03:002:016 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

 03:003:001 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD.

 03:003:002 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.

 03:003:003 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,

 03:003:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.

 03:003:005 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 03:003:006 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.

 03:003:007 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the LORD.

 03:003:008 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar.

 03:003:009 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,

 03:003:010 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.

 03:003:011 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the LORD.

 03:003:012 And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the LORD.

 03:003:013 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.

 03:003:014 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,

 03:003:015 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.

 03:003:016 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the LORD's.

 03:003:017 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.

 03:004:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:004:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:

 03:004:003 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.

 03:004:004 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.

 03:004:005 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:

 03:004:006 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.

 03:004:007 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 03:004:008 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,

 03:004:009 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away,

 03:004:010 As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering.

 03:004:011 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,

 03:004:012 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.

 03:004:013 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;

 03:004:014 When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.

 03:004:015 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD.

 03:004:016 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:

 03:004:017 And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail.

 03:004:018 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 03:004:019 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar.

 03:004:020 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.

 03:004:021 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation.

 03:004:022 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;

 03:004:023 Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:

 03:004:024 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.

 03:004:025 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.

 03:004:026 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.

 03:004:027 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;

 03:004:028 Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.

 03:004:029 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.

 03:004:030 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.

 03:004:031 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.

 03:004:032 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish.

 03:004:033 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.

 03:004:034 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:

 03:004:035 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.

 03:005:001 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.

 03:005:002 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.

 03:005:003 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.

 03:005:004 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these.

 03:005:005 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing:

 03:005:006 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin.

 03:005:007 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering.

 03:005:008 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder:

 03:005:009 And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering.

 03:005:010 And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.

 03:005:011 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.

 03:005:012 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sin offering.

 03:005:013 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.

 03:005:014 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:005:015 If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.

 03:005:016 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.

 03:005:017 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.

 03:005:018 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.

 03:005:019 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the LORD.

 03:006:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:006:002 If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour;

 03:006:003 Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein:

 03:006:004 Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,

 03:006:005 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass offering.

 03:006:006 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest:

 03:006:007 And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein.

 03:006:008 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:006:009 Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.

 03:006:010 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.

 03:006:011 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.

 03:006:012 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.

 03:006:013 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.

 03:006:014 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.

 03:006:015 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD.

 03:006:016 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.

 03:006:017 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.

 03:006:018 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy.

 03:006:019 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:006:020 This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night.

 03:006:021 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 03:006:022 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly burnt.

 03:006:023 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.

 03:006:024 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:006:025 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy.

 03:006:026 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 03:006:027 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.

 03:006:028 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water.

 03:006:029 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy.

 03:006:030 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.

 03:007:001 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy.

 03:007:002 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.

 03:007:003 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,

 03:007:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:

 03:007:005 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering.

 03:007:006 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.

 03:007:007 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it.

 03:007:008 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered.

 03:007:009 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it.

 03:007:010 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.

 03:007:011 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD.

 03:007:012 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.

 03:007:013 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.

 03:007:014 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.

 03:007:015 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.

 03:007:016 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:

 03:007:017 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.

 03:007:018 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.

 03:007:019 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.

 03:007:020 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

 03:007:021 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

 03:007:022 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:007:023 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.

 03:007:024 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it.

 03:007:025 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.

 03:007:026 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.

 03:007:027 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

 03:007:028 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:007:029 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.

 03:007:030 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.

 03:007:031 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.

 03:007:032 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

 03:007:033 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.

 03:007:034 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel.

 03:007:035 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest's office;

 03:007:036 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations.

 03:007:037 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;

 03:007:038 Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.

 03:008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:008:002 Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;

 03:008:003 And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 03:008:004 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 03:008:005 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the LORD commanded to be done.

 03:008:006 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.

 03:008:007 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.

 03:008:008 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.

 03:008:009 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 03:008:010 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.

 03:008:011 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.

 03:008:012 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.

 03:008:013 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 03:008:014 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.

 03:008:015 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.

 03:008:016 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar.

 03:008:017 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 03:008:018 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

 03:008:019 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.

 03:008:020 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.

 03:008:021 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 03:008:022 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

 03:008:023 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.

 03:008:024 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.

 03:008:025 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:

 03:008:026 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:

 03:008:027 And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.

 03:008:028 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

 03:008:029 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 03:008:030 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.

 03:008:031 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.

 03:008:032 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.

 03:008:033 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.

 03:008:034 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.

 03:008:035 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.

 03:008:036 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.

 03:009:001 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;

 03:009:002 And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.

 03:009:003 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;

 03:009:004 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.

 03:009:005 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.

 03:009:006 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.

 03:009:007 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.

 03:009:008 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.

 03:009:009 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:

 03:009:010 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 03:009:011 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.

 03:009:012 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.

 03:009:013 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.

 03:009:014 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.

 03:009:015 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.

 03:009:016 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.

 03:009:017 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.

 03:009:018 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,

 03:009:019 And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:

 03:009:020 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:

 03:009:021 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.

 03:009:022 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.

 03:009:023 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.

 03:009:024 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.

 03:010:001 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.

 03:010:002 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.

 03:010:003 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.

 03:010:004 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.

 03:010:005 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.

 03:010:006 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.

 03:010:007 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.

 03:010:008 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,

 03:010:009 Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:

 03:010:010 And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;

 03:010:011 And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.

 03:010:012 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:

 03:010:013 And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.

 03:010:014 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.

 03:010:015 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.

 03:010:016 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,

 03:010:017 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?

 03:010:018 Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.

 03:010:019 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?

 03:010:020 And when Moses heard that, he was content.

 03:011:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,

 03:011:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.

 03:011:003 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.

 03:011:004 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.

 03:011:005 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.

 03:011:006 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.

 03:011:007 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.

 03:011:008 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.

 03:011:009 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.

 03:011:010 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:

 03:011:011 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.

 03:011:012 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.

 03:011:013 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,

 03:011:014 And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;

 03:011:015 Every raven after his kind;

 03:011:016 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,

 03:011:017 And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,

 03:011:018 And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,

 03:011:019 And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.

 03:011:020 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you.

 03:011:021 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;

 03:011:022 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.

 03:011:023 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you.

 03:011:024 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.

 03:011:025 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

 03:011:026 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.

 03:011:027 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.

 03:011:028 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.

 03:011:029 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,

 03:011:030 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.

 03:011:031 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.

 03:011:032 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.

 03:011:033 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.

 03:011:034 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.

 03:011:035 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you.

 03:011:036 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.

 03:011:037 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean.

 03:011:038 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.

 03:011:039 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.

 03:011:040 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

 03:011:041 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten.

 03:011:042 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.

 03:011:043 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.

 03:011:044 For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

 03:011:045 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.

 03:011:046 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:

 03:011:047 To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.

 03:012:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:012:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.

 03:012:003 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.

 03:012:004 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.

 03:012:005 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.

 03:012:006 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:

 03:012:007 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female.

 03:012:008 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.

 03:013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,

 03:013:002 When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:

 03:013:003 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.

 03:013:004 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days:

 03:013:005 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:

 03:013:006 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

 03:013:007 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again.

 03:013:008 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.

 03:013:009 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;

 03:013:010 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising;

 03:013:011 It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.

 03:013:012 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;

 03:013:013 Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.

 03:013:014 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.

 03:013:015 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.

 03:013:016 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;

 03:013:017 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.

 03:013:018 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,

 03:013:019 And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest;

 03:013:020 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.

 03:013:021 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:

 03:013:022 And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.

 03:013:023 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

 03:013:024 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;

 03:013:025 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.

 03:013:026 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:

 03:013:027 And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.

 03:013:028 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the burning.

 03:013:029 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;

 03:013:030 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard.

 03:013:031 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:

 03:013:032 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin;

 03:013:033 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:

 03:013:034 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

 03:013:035 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;

 03:013:036 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is unclean.

 03:013:037 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

 03:013:038 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;

 03:013:039 Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.

 03:013:040 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean.

 03:013:041 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.

 03:013:042 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.

 03:013:043 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;

 03:013:044 He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.

 03:013:045 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.

 03:013:046 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be.

 03:013:047 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;

 03:013:048 Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;

 03:013:049 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest:

 03:013:050 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that hath the plague seven days:

 03:013:051 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.

 03:013:052 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.

 03:013:053 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;

 03:013:054 Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:

 03:013:055 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.

 03:013:056 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:

 03:013:057 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.

 03:013:058 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.

 03:013:059 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

 03:014:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:014:002 This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest:

 03:014:003 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper;

 03:014:004 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

 03:014:005 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water:

 03:014:006 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:

 03:014:007 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.

 03:014:008 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.

 03:014:009 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.

 03:014:010 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.

 03:014:011 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:

 03:014:012 And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD:

 03:014:013 And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy:

 03:014:014 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:

 03:014:015 And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand:

 03:014:016 And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD:

 03:014:017 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering:

 03:014:018 And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD.

 03:014:019 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:

 03:014:020 And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.

 03:014:021 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;

 03:014:022 And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering.

 03:014:023 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the LORD.

 03:014:024 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD:

 03:014:025 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:

 03:014:026 And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand:

 03:014:027 And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD:

 03:014:028 And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering:

 03:014:029 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the LORD.

 03:014:030 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as he can get;

 03:014:031 Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD.

 03:014:032 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.

 03:014:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

 03:014:034 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;

 03:014:035 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house:

 03:014:036 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:

 03:014:037 And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;

 03:014:038 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days:

 03:014:039 And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;

 03:014:040 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:

 03:014:041 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:

 03:014:042 And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house.

 03:014:043 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;

 03:014:044 Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean.

 03:014:045 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.

 03:014:046 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.

 03:014:047 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.

 03:014:048 And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.

 03:014:049 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

 03:014:050 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:

 03:014:051 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:

 03:014:052 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:

 03:014:053 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.

 03:014:054 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,

 03:014:055 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,

 03:014:056 And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:

 03:014:057 To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.

 03:015:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,

 03:015:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.

 03:015:003 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness.

 03:015:004 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.

 03:015:005 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

 03:015:006 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

 03:015:007 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

 03:015:008 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

 03:015:009 And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall be unclean.

 03:015:010 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even: and he that beareth any of those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

 03:015:011 And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

 03:015:012 And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue, shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.

 03:015:013 And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.

 03:015:014 And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the priest:

 03:015:015 And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue.

 03:015:016 And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.

 03:015:017 And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even.

 03:015:018 The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even.

 03:015:019 And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.

 03:015:020 And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.

 03:015:021 And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

 03:015:022 And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

 03:015:023 And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.

 03:015:024 And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean.

 03:015:025 And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.

 03:015:026 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.

 03:015:027 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

 03:015:028 But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

 03:015:029 And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 03:015:030 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.

 03:015:031 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is among them.

 03:015:032 This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;

 03:015:033 And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.

 03:016:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;

 03:016:002 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.

 03:016:003 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.

 03:016:004 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.

 03:016:005 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.

 03:016:006 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.

 03:016:007 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 03:016:008 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.

 03:016:009 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.

 03:016:010 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.

 03:016:011 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:

 03:016:012 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:

 03:016:013 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:

 03:016:014 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.

 03:016:015 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:

 03:016:016 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.

 03:016:017 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.

 03:016:018 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.

 03:016:019 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.

 03:016:020 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat:

 03:016:021 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:

 03:016:022 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.

 03:016:023 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:

 03:016:024 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.

 03:016:025 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.

 03:016:026 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.

 03:016:027 And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.

 03:016:028 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.

 03:016:029 And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:

 03:016:030 For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.

 03:016:031 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls, by a statute for ever.

 03:016:032 And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments:

 03:016:033 And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.

 03:016:034 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.

 03:017:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:017:002 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying,

 03:017:003 What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp,

 03:017:004 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:

 03:017:005 To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace offerings unto the LORD.

 03:017:006 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 03:017:007 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.

 03:017:008 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,

 03:017:009 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.

 03:017:010 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.

 03:017:011 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.

 03:017:012 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.

 03:017:013 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.

 03:017:014 For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.

 03:017:015 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.

 03:017:016 But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.

 03:018:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:018:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God.

 03:018:003 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.

 03:018:004 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God.

 03:018:005 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.

 03:018:006 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.

 03:018:007 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

 03:018:008 The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness.

 03:018:009 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.

 03:018:010 The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness.

 03:018:011 The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

 03:018:012 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman.

 03:018:013 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.

 03:018:014 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.

 03:018:015 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

 03:018:016 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness.

 03:018:017 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.

 03:018:018 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.

 03:018:019 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.

 03:018:020 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her.

 03:018:021 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.

 03:018:022 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.

 03:018:023 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion.

 03:018:024 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:

 03:018:025 And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.

 03:018:026 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:

 03:018:027 (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;)

 03:018:028 That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.

 03:018:029 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people.

 03:018:030 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God.

 03:019:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:019:002 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy.

 03:019:003 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.

 03:019:004 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.

 03:019:005 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will.

 03:019:006 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.

 03:019:007 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted.

 03:019:008 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

 03:019:009 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.

 03:019:010 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God.

 03:019:011 Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.

 03:019:012 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.

 03:019:013 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.

 03:019:014 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.

 03:019:015 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.

 03:019:016 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour; I am the LORD.

 03:019:017 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.

 03:019:018 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.

 03:019:019 Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.

 03:019:020 And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.

 03:019:021 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering.

 03:019:022 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.

 03:019:023 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.

 03:019:024 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal.

 03:019:025 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.

 03:019:026 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.

 03:019:027 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.

 03:019:028 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.

 03:019:029 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.

 03:019:030 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.

 03:019:031 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.

 03:019:032 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.

 03:019:033 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.

 03:019:034 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

 03:019:035 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.

 03:019:036 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.

 03:019:037 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.

 03:020:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:020:002 Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.

 03:020:003 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

 03:020:004 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:

 03:020:005 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.

 03:020:006 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.

 03:020:007 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God.

 03:020:008 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you.

 03:020:009 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.

 03:020:010 And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.

 03:020:011 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

 03:020:012 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.

 03:020:013 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

 03:020:014 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.

 03:020:015 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.

 03:020:016 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

 03:020:017 And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.

 03:020:018 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.

 03:020:019 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.

 03:020:020 And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.

 03:020:021 And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.

 03:020:022 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.

 03:020:023 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.

 03:020:024 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people.

 03:020:025 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.

 03:020:026 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.

 03:020:027 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.

 03:021:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people:

 03:021:002 But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother.

 03:021:003 And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled.

 03:021:004 But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.

 03:021:005 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.

 03:021:006 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.

 03:021:007 They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God.

 03:021:008 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy.

 03:021:009 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.

 03:021:010 And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;

 03:021:011 Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;

 03:021:012 Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD.

 03:021:013 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.

 03:021:014 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.

 03:021:015 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.

 03:021:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:021:017 Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.

 03:021:018 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,

 03:021:019 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,

 03:021:020 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;

 03:021:021 No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.

 03:021:022 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.

 03:021:023 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

 03:021:024 And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.

 03:022:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:022:002 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD.

 03:022:003 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.

 03:022:004 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;

 03:022:005 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;

 03:022:006 The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.

 03:022:007 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.

 03:022:008 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.

 03:022:009 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.

 03:022:010 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.

 03:022:011 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.

 03:022:012 If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.

 03:022:013 But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be no stranger eat thereof.

 03:022:014 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing.

 03:022:015 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;

 03:022:016 Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

 03:022:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:022:018 Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;

 03:022:019 Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.

 03:022:020 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.

 03:022:021 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.

 03:022:022 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.

 03:022:023 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.

 03:022:024 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land.

 03:022:025 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.

 03:022:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:022:027 When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

 03:022:028 And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.

 03:022:029 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer it at your own will.

 03:022:030 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the LORD.

 03:022:031 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the LORD.

 03:022:032 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,

 03:022:033 That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD.

 03:023:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:023:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.

 03:023:003 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.

 03:023:004 These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.

 03:023:005 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's passover.

 03:023:006 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.

 03:023:007 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.

 03:023:008 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.

 03:023:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:023:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:

 03:023:011 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.

 03:023:012 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.

 03:023:013 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin.

 03:023:014 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

 03:023:015 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:

 03:023:016 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD.

 03:023:017 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.

 03:023:018 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.

 03:023:019 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.

 03:023:020 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.

 03:023:021 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.

 03:023:022 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God.

 03:023:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:023:024 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.

 03:023:025 Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

 03:023:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:023:027 Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

 03:023:028 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.

 03:023:029 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.

 03:023:030 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.

 03:023:031 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

 03:023:032 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

 03:023:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:023:034 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD.

 03:023:035 On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.

 03:023:036 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.

 03:023:037 These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:

 03:023:038 Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.

 03:023:039 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.

 03:023:040 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.

 03:023:041 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month.

 03:023:042 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:

 03:023:043 That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

 03:023:044 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.

 03:024:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:024:002 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.

 03:024:003 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your generations.

 03:024:004 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.

 03:024:005 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.

 03:024:006 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD.

 03:024:007 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

 03:024:008 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.

 03:024:009 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.

 03:024:010 And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;

 03:024:011 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)

 03:024:012 And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.

 03:024:013 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:024:014 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.

 03:024:015 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.

 03:024:016 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.

 03:024:017 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.

 03:024:018 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.

 03:024:019 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;

 03:024:020 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.

 03:024:021 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.

 03:024:022 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.

 03:024:023 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.

 03:025:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,

 03:025:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.

 03:025:003 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;

 03:025:004 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.

 03:025:005 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land.

 03:025:006 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.

 03:025:007 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.

 03:025:008 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.

 03:025:009 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.

 03:025:010 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.

 03:025:011 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.

 03:025:012 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.

 03:025:013 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.

 03:025:014 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:

 03:025:015 According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:

 03:025:016 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.

 03:025:017 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am the LORD your God.

 03:025:018 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.

 03:025:019 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.

 03:025:020 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:

 03:025:021 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.

 03:025:022 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.

 03:025:023 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.

 03:025:024 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.

 03:025:025 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.

 03:025:026 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;

 03:025:027 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.

 03:025:028 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.

 03:025:029 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.

 03:025:030 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.

 03:025:031 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.

 03:025:032 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.

 03:025:033 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.

 03:025:034 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.

 03:025:035 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.

 03:025:036 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.

 03:025:037 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.

 03:025:038 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.

 03:025:039 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:

 03:025:040 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.

 03:025:041 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.

 03:025:042 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.

 03:025:043 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.

 03:025:044 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.

 03:025:045 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.

 03:025:046 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.

 03:025:047 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:

 03:025:048 After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:

 03:025:049 Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.

 03:025:050 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.

 03:025:051 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.

 03:025:052 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.

 03:025:053 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.

 03:025:054 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.

 03:025:055 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

 03:026:001 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.

 03:026:002 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.

 03:026:003 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;

 03:026:004 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.

 03:026:005 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.

 03:026:006 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.

 03:026:007 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.

 03:026:008 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.

 03:026:009 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.

 03:026:010 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.

 03:026:011 And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.

 03:026:012 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.

 03:026:013 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.

 03:026:014 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;

 03:026:015 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant:

 03:026:016 I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.

 03:026:017 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.

 03:026:018 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.

 03:026:019 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:

 03:026:020 And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.

 03:026:021 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.

 03:026:022 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.

 03:026:023 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;

 03:026:024 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.

 03:026:025 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

 03:026:026 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.

 03:026:027 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;

 03:026:028 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.

 03:026:029 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.

 03:026:030 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.

 03:026:031 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.

 03:026:032 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.

 03:026:033 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.

 03:026:034 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.

 03:026:035 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.

 03:026:036 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.

 03:026:037 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.

 03:026:038 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.

 03:026:039 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.

 03:026:040 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;

 03:026:041 And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:

 03:026:042 Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.

 03:026:043 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.

 03:026:044 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God.

 03:026:045 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.

 03:026:046 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.

 03:027:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 03:027:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.

 03:027:003 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

 03:027:004 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.

 03:027:005 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.

 03:027:006 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.

 03:027:007 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.

 03:027:008 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.

 03:027:009 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.

 03:027:010 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.

 03:027:011 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:

 03:027:012 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.

 03:027:013 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.

 03:027:014 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.

 03:027:015 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.

 03:027:016 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.

 03:027:017 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.

 03:027:018 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.

 03:027:019 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.

 03:027:020 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.

 03:027:021 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.

 03:027:022 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;

 03:027:023 Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.

 03:027:024 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.

 03:027:025 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.

 03:027:026 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD's.

 03:027:027 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.

 03:027:028 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.

 03:027:029 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.

 03:027:030 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD.

 03:027:031 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.

 03:027:032 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.

 03:027:033 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

 03:027:034 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.

 04:001:018 And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.

 04:001:019 As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.

 04:001:020 And the children of Reuben, Israel's eldest son, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;

 04:001:046 Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

 04:001:047 But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.

 04:001:048 For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying,

 04:001:049 Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel:

 04:001:050 But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.

 04:001:051 And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

 04:001:052 And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.

 04:001:053 But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.

 04:001:054 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.

 04:002:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

 04:002:002 Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of their father's house: far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch.

 04:002:003 And on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their armies: and Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be captain of the children of Judah.

 04:002:004 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.

 04:002:005 And those that do pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of Issachar: and Nethaneel the son of Zuar shall be captain of the children of Issachar.

 04:002:006 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and four thousand and four hundred.

 04:002:008 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred.

 04:002:009 All that were numbered in the camp of Judah were an hundred thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred, throughout their armies. These shall first set forth.

 04:002:010 On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their armies: and the captain of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.

 04:002:011 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were forty and six thousand and five hundred.

 04:002:012 And those which pitch by him shall be the tribe of Simeon: and the captain of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

 04:002:013 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred.

 04:002:014 Then the tribe of Gad: and the captain of the sons of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.

 04:002:015 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty and five thousand and six hundred and fifty.

 04:002:016 All that were numbered in the camp of Reuben were an hundred thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and fifty, throughout their armies. And they shall set forth in the second rank.

 04:002:017 Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp: as they encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place by their standards.

 04:002:018 On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their armies: and the captain of the sons of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.

 04:002:019 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty thousand and five hundred.

 04:002:020 And by him shall be the tribe of Manasseh: and the captain of the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

 04:002:021 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred.

 04:002:022 Then the tribe of Benjamin: and the captain of the sons of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni.

 04:002:023 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred.

 04:002:024 All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were an hundred thousand and eight thousand and an hundred, throughout their armies. And they shall go forward in the third rank.

 04:002:025 The standard of the camp of Dan shall be on the north side by their armies: and the captain of the children of Dan shall be Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

 04:002:026 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.

 04:002:027 And those that encamp by him shall be the tribe of Asher: and the captain of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel the son of Ocran.

 04:002:028 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty and one thousand and five hundred.

 04:002:029 Then the tribe of Naphtali: and the captain of the children of Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan.

 04:002:030 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.

 04:002:031 All they that were numbered in the camp of Dan were an hundred thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred. They shall go hindmost with their standards.

 04:002:032 These are those which were numbered of the children of Israel by the house of their fathers: all those that were numbered of the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

 04:002:033 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 04:002:034 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so they set forward, every one after their families, according to the house of their fathers.

 04:003:001 These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai.

 04:003:002 And these are the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

 04:003:003 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office.

 04:003:004 And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office in the sight of Aaron their father.

 04:003:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:003:006 Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him.

 04:003:007 And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle.

 04:003:008 And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.

 04:003:009 And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.

 04:003:010 And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

 04:003:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:003:012 And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine;

 04:003:013 Because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they be: I am the LORD.

 04:003:014 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,

 04:003:015 Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.

 04:003:016 And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he was commanded.

 04:003:017 And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari.

 04:003:018 And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families; Libni, and Shimei.

 04:003:019 And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel.

 04:003:020 And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to the house of their fathers.

 04:003:021 Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of the Shimites: these are the families of the Gershonites.

 04:003:022 Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred.

 04:003:023 The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernacle westward.

 04:003:024 And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.

 04:003:025 And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,

 04:003:026 And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof.

 04:003:027 And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the Kohathites.

 04:003:028 In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.

 04:003:029 The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward.

 04:003:030 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.

 04:003:031 And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service thereof.

 04:003:032 And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary.

 04:003:033 Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites: these are the families of Merari.

 04:003:034 And those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six thousand and two hundred.

 04:003:035 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail: these shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle northward.

 04:003:036 And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels thereof, and all that serveth thereto,

 04:003:037 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords.

 04:003:038 But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

 04:003:039 All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand.

 04:003:040 And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.

 04:003:041 And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel.

 04:003:042 And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel.

 04:003:043 And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.

 04:003:044 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:003:045 Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the LORD.

 04:003:046 And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are more than the Levites;

 04:003:047 Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel is twenty gerahs:)

 04:003:048 And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.

 04:003:049 And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites:

 04:003:050 Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money; a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:

 04:003:051 And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.

 04:004:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

 04:004:002 Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after their families, by the house of their fathers,

 04:004:003 From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.

 04:004:004 This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation, about the most holy things:

 04:004:005 And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover the ark of testimony with it:

 04:004:006 And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves thereof.

 04:004:007 And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon:

 04:004:008 And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in the staves thereof.

 04:004:009 And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it:

 04:004:010 And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put it upon a bar.

 04:004:011 And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put to the staves thereof:

 04:004:012 And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put them on a bar:

 04:004:013 And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon:

 04:004:014 And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and put to the staves of it.

 04:004:015 And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation.

 04:004:016 And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof.

 04:004:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying,

 04:004:018 Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites:

 04:004:019 But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:

 04:004:020 But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest they die.

 04:004:021 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:004:022 Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of their fathers, by their families;

 04:004:023 From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.

 04:004:024 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve, and for burdens:

 04:004:025 And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,

 04:004:026 And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and all that is made for them: so shall they serve.

 04:004:027 At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their service: and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens.

 04:004:028 This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

 04:004:029 As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their families, by the house of their fathers;

 04:004:030 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, every one that entereth into the service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 04:004:031 And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets thereof,

 04:004:032 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all their service: and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden.

 04:004:033 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the congregation, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

 04:004:034 And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the house of their fathers,

 04:004:035 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation:

 04:004:036 And those that were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty.

 04:004:037 These were they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

 04:004:038 And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, throughout their families, and by the house of their fathers,

 04:004:039 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation,

 04:004:040 Even those that were numbered of them, throughout their families, by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and six hundred and thirty.

 04:004:041 These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon, of all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the LORD.

 04:004:042 And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, throughout their families, by the house of their fathers,

 04:004:043 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation,

 04:004:044 Even those that were numbered of them after their families, were three thousand and two hundred.

 04:004:045 These be those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

 04:004:046 All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the chief of Israel numbered, after their families, and after the house of their fathers,

 04:004:047 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation.

 04:004:048 Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore,

 04:004:049 According to the commandment of the LORD they were numbered by the hand of Moses, every one according to his service, and according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as the LORD commanded Moses.

 04:005:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:005:002 Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead:

 04:005:003 Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.

 04:005:004 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.

 04:005:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:005:006 Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty;

 04:005:007 Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed.

 04:005:008 But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.

 04:005:009 And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.

 04:005:010 And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his.

 04:005:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:005:012 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,

 04:005:013 And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner;

 04:005:014 And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:

 04:005:015 Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.

 04:005:016 And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:

 04:005:017 And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water:

 04:005:018 And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse:

 04:005:019 And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:

 04:005:020 But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband:

 04:005:021 Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell;

 04:005:022 And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.

 04:005:023 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water:

 04:005:024 And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.

 04:005:025 Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar:

 04:005:026 And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.

 04:005:027 And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.

 04:005:028 And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.

 04:005:029 This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband, and is defiled;

 04:005:030 Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.

 04:005:031 Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.

 04:006:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:006:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the LORD:

 04:006:003 He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.

 04:006:004 All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.

 04:006:005 All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.

 04:006:006 All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall come at no dead body.

 04:006:007 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is upon his head.

 04:006:008 All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.

 04:006:009 And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.

 04:006:010 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:

 04:006:011 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.

 04:006:012 And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.

 04:006:013 And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:

 04:006:014 And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,

 04:006:015 And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings.

 04:006:016 And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering:

 04:006:017 And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.

 04:006:018 And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.

 04:006:019 And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his separation is shaven:

 04:006:020 And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.

 04:006:021 This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation.

 04:006:022 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:006:023 Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,

 04:006:024 The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:

 04:006:025 The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:

 04:006:026 The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.

 04:006:027 And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.

 04:007:001 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them;

 04:007:002 That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered:

 04:007:003 And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle.

 04:007:004 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:007:005 Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service.

 04:007:006 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites.

 04:007:007 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service:

 04:007:008 And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

 04:007:009 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders.

 04:007:010 And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar.

 04:007:011 And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.

 04:007:012 And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah:

 04:008:002 Speak unto Aaron and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.

 04:008:008 Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering.

 04:008:009 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together:

 04:008:010 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:

 04:008:011 And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the LORD.

 04:008:012 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an atonement for the Levites.

 04:008:013 And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for an offering unto the LORD.

 04:008:014 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.

 04:008:015 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for an offering.

 04:008:016 For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.

 04:008:017 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.

 04:008:018 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel.

 04:008:019 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.

 04:008:020 And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.

 04:008:021 And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them.

 04:008:022 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.

 04:008:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:008:024 This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:

 04:008:025 And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more:

 04:008:026 But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.

 04:009:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,

 04:009:002 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.

 04:009:003 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.

 04:009:004 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.

 04:009:005 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.

 04:009:006 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:

 04:009:007 And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?

 04:009:008 And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.

 04:009:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:009:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.

 04:009:011 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

 04:009:012 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.

 04:009:013 But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.

 04:009:014 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.

 04:009:015 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.

 04:009:016 So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.

 04:009:017 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.

 04:009:018 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.

 04:009:019 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.

 04:009:020 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.

 04:009:021 And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.

 04:009:022 Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.

 04:009:023 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

 04:010:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:010:002 Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.

 04:010:003 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 04:010:004 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.

 04:010:005 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.

 04:010:006 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.

 04:010:007 But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.

 04:010:008 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.

 04:010:009 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.

 04:010:010 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.

 04:010:011 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.

 04:010:012 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.

 04:010:013 And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

 04:010:014 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

 04:010:015 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar.

 04:010:016 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.

 04:010:017 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.

 04:010:018 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.

 04:010:019 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

 04:010:020 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.

 04:010:021 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came.

 04:010:022 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.

 04:010:023 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

 04:010:024 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.

 04:010:025 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

 04:010:026 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.

 04:010:027 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.

 04:010:028 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward.

 04:010:029 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.

 04:010:030 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.

 04:010:031 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.

 04:010:032 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.

 04:010:033 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.

 04:010:034 And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp.

 04:010:035 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.

 04:010:036 And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel.

 04:011:001 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.

 04:011:002 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched.

 04:011:003 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.

 04:011:004 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?

 04:011:005 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:

 04:011:006 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.

 04:011:007 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium.

 04:011:008 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

 04:011:009 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.

 04:011:010 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.

 04:011:011 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?

 04:011:012 Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?

 04:011:013 Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

 04:011:014 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.

 04:011:015 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.

 04:011:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee.

 04:011:017 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.

 04:011:018 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.

 04:011:019 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;

 04:011:020 But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?

 04:011:021 And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.

 04:011:022 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?

 04:011:023 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.

 04:011:024 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.

 04:011:025 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.

 04:011:026 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.

 04:011:027 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.

 04:011:028 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.

 04:011:029 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them!

 04:011:030 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.

 04:011:031 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.

 04:011:032 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.

 04:011:033 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.

 04:011:034 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.

 04:011:035 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.

 04:012:001 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.

 04:012:002 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.

 04:012:003 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.)

 04:012:004 And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.

 04:012:005 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.

 04:012:006 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream.

 04:012:007 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.

 04:012:008 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?

 04:012:009 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.

 04:012:010 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.

 04:012:011 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.

 04:012:012 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb.

 04:012:013 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.

 04:012:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.

 04:012:015 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.

 04:012:016 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.

 04:013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:013:002 Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.

 04:013:003 And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel.

 04:013:004 And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.

 04:013:005 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

 04:013:006 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

 04:013:007 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.

 04:013:008 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.

 04:013:009 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.

 04:013:010 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.

 04:013:011 Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.

 04:013:012 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.

 04:013:013 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.

 04:013:014 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.

 04:013:015 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

 04:013:016 These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.

 04:013:017 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:

 04:013:018 And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;

 04:013:019 And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;

 04:013:020 And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes.

 04:013:021 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.

 04:013:022 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)

 04:013:023 And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.

 04:013:024 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.

 04:013:025 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.

 04:013:026 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.

 04:013:027 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.

 04:013:028 Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.

 04:013:029 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.

 04:013:030 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.

 04:013:031 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.

 04:013:032 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.

 04:013:033 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.

 04:014:001 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.

 04:014:002 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!

 04:014:003 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?

 04:014:004 And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.

 04:014:005 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.

 04:014:006 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:

 04:014:007 And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.

 04:014:008 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.

 04:014:009 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.

 04:014:010 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.

 04:014:011 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?

 04:014:012 I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.

 04:014:013 And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)

 04:014:014 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.

 04:014:015 Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,

 04:014:016 Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.

 04:014:017 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,

 04:014:018 The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.

 04:014:019 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.

 04:014:020 And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:

 04:014:021 But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.

 04:014:022 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;

 04:014:023 Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:

 04:014:024 But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.

 04:014:025 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.

 04:014:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

 04:014:027 How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.

 04:014:028 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:

 04:014:029 Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against me.

 04:014:030 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

 04:014:031 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.

 04:014:032 But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness.

 04:014:033 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.

 04:014:034 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.

 04:014:035 I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.

 04:014:036 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,

 04:014:037 Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.

 04:014:038 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.

 04:014:039 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.

 04:014:040 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.

 04:014:041 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.

 04:014:042 Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.

 04:014:043 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.

 04:014:044 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.

 04:014:045 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.

 04:015:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:015:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,

 04:015:003 And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:

 04:015:004 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil.

 04:015:005 And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.

 04:015:006 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.

 04:015:007 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 04:015:008 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD:

 04:015:009 Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.

 04:015:010 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 04:015:011 Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid.

 04:015:012 According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.

 04:015:013 All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 04:015:014 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.

 04:015:015 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD.

 04:015:016 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.

 04:015:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:015:018 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,

 04:015:019 Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.

 04:015:020 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it.

 04:015:021 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations.

 04:015:022 And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,

 04:015:023 Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations;

 04:015:024 Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.

 04:015:025 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:

 04:015:026 And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance.

 04:015:027 And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.

 04:015:028 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.

 04:015:029 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.

 04:015:030 But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

 04:015:031 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.

 04:015:032 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.

 04:015:033 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.

 04:015:034 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.

 04:015:035 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.

 04:015:036 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 04:015:037 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:015:038 Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:

 04:015:039 And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:

 04:015:040 That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.

 04:015:041 I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.

 04:016:001 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:

 04:016:002 And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:

 04:016:003 And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?

 04:016:004 And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:

 04:016:005 And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him.

 04:016:006 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;

 04:016:007 And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.

 04:016:008 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:

 04:016:009 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?

 04:016:010 And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?

 04:016:011 For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?

 04:016:012 And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:

 04:016:013 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?

 04:016:014 Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.

 04:016:015 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.

 04:016:016 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:

 04:016:017 And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.

 04:016:018 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.

 04:016:019 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.

 04:016:020 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

 04:016:021 Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.

 04:016:022 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?

 04:016:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:016:024 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

 04:016:025 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.

 04:016:026 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.

 04:016:027 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.

 04:016:028 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.

 04:016:029 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me.

 04:016:030 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.

 04:016:031 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:

 04:016:032 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.

 04:016:033 They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.

 04:016:034 And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.

 04:016:035 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.

 04:016:036 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:016:037 Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.

 04:016:038 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.

 04:016:039 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:

 04:016:040 To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.

 04:016:041 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD.

 04:016:042 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.

 04:016:043 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.

 04:016:044 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:016:045 Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.

 04:016:046 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.

 04:016:047 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.

 04:016:048 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.

 04:016:049 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.

 04:016:050 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.

 04:017:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:017:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.

 04:017:003 And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.

 04:017:004 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.

 04:017:005 And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.

 04:017:006 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.

 04:017:007 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.

 04:017:008 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.

 04:017:009 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.

 04:017:010 And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.

 04:017:011 And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.

 04:017:012 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.

 04:017:013 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

 04:018:001 And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.

 04:018:002 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.

 04:018:003 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.

 04:018:004 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.

 04:018:005 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.

 04:018:006 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 04:018:007 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

 04:018:008 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.

 04:018:009 This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of their's, every meat offering of their's, and every sin offering of their's, and every trespass offering of their's which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.

 04:018:010 In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy unto thee.

 04:018:011 And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.

 04:018:012 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD, them have I given thee.

 04:018:013 And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it.

 04:018:014 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.

 04:018:015 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.

 04:018:016 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.

 04:018:017 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 04:018:018 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine.

 04:018:019 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.

 04:018:020 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.

 04:018:021 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 04:018:022 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.

 04:018:023 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.

 04:018:024 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.

 04:018:025 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:018:026 Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.

 04:018:027 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress.

 04:018:028 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest.

 04:018:029 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.

 04:018:030 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.

 04:018:031 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.

 04:018:032 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.

 04:019:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

 04:019:002 This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:

 04:019:003 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:

 04:019:004 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:

 04:019:005 And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:

 04:019:006 And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

 04:019:007 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.

 04:019:008 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.

 04:019:009 And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.

 04:019:010 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.

 04:019:011 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.

 04:019:012 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.

 04:019:013 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.

 04:019:014 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.

 04:019:015 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.

 04:019:016 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.

 04:019:017 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:

 04:019:018 And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:

 04:019:019 And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.

 04:019:020 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.

 04:019:021 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.

 04:019:022 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.

 04:020:001 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.

 04:020:002 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.

 04:020:003 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!

 04:020:004 And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?

 04:020:005 And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.

 04:020:006 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.

 04:020:007 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:020:008 Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.

 04:020:009 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.

 04:020:010 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?

 04:020:011 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.

 04:020:012 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.

 04:020:013 This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.

 04:020:014 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:

 04:020:015 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:

 04:020:016 And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:

 04:020:017 Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.

 04:020:018 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.

 04:020:019 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.

 04:020:020 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.

 04:020:021 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.

 04:020:022 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.

 04:020:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,

 04:020:024 Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.

 04:020:025 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor:

 04:020:026 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.

 04:020:027 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.

 04:020:028 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.

 04:020:029 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.

 04:021:001 And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.

 04:021:002 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.

 04:021:003 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.

 04:021:004 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.

 04:021:005 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.

 04:021:006 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.

 04:021:007 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.

 04:021:008 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.

 04:021:009 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.

 04:021:010 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.

 04:021:011 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.

 04:021:012 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.

 04:021:013 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.

 04:021:014 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,

 04:021:015 And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.

 04:021:016 And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.

 04:021:017 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:

 04:021:018 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:

 04:021:019 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:

 04:021:020 And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.

 04:021:021 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,

 04:021:022 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past thy borders.

 04:021:023 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.

 04:021:024 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.

 04:021:025 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.

 04:021:026 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.

 04:021:027 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:

 04:021:028 For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.

 04:021:029 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.

 04:021:030 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.

 04:021:031 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

 04:021:032 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.

 04:021:033 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.

 04:021:034 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

 04:021:035 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.

 04:022:001 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.

 04:022:002 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.

 04:022:003 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.

 04:022:004 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.

 04:022:005 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:

 04:022:006 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.

 04:022:007 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.

 04:022:008 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.

 04:022:009 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?

 04:022:010 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,

 04:022:011 Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.

 04:022:012 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.

 04:022:013 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.

 04:022:014 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.

 04:022:015 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.

 04:022:016 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:

 04:022:017 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.

 04:022:018 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.

 04:022:019 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.

 04:022:020 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.

 04:022:021 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.

 04:022:022 And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.

 04:022:023 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.

 04:022:024 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.

 04:022:025 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.

 04:022:026 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.

 04:022:027 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.

 04:022:028 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?

 04:022:029 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.

 04:022:030 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.

 04:022:031 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.

 04:022:032 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:

 04:022:033 And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.

 04:022:034 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.

 04:022:035 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

 04:022:036 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast.

 04:022:037 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?

 04:022:038 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.

 04:022:039 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.

 04:022:040 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.

 04:022:041 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.

 04:023:001 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.

 04:023:002 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.

 04:023:003 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.

 04:023:004 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.

 04:023:005 And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.

 04:023:006 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.

 04:023:007 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.

 04:023:008 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?

 04:023:009 For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.

 04:023:010 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!

 04:023:011 And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.

 04:023:012 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?

 04:023:013 And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.

 04:023:014 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.

 04:023:015 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet the LORD yonder.

 04:023:016 And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.

 04:023:017 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?

 04:023:018 And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:

 04:023:019 God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?

 04:023:020 Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.

 04:023:021 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.

 04:023:022 God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.

 04:023:023 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!

 04:023:024 Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.

 04:023:025 And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.

 04:023:026 But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?

 04:023:027 And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.

 04:023:028 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon.

 04:023:029 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

 04:023:030 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.

 04:024:001 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.

 04:024:002 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.

 04:024:003 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

 04:024:004 He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:

 04:024:005 How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!

 04:024:006 As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.

 04:024:007 He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.

 04:024:008 God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.

 04:024:009 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.

 04:024:010 And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.

 04:024:011 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.

 04:024:012 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,

 04:024:013 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak?

 04:024:014 And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.

 04:024:015 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

 04:024:016 He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:

 04:024:017 I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.

 04:024:018 And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.

 04:024:019 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.

 04:024:020 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.

 04:024:021 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.

 04:024:022 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.

 04:024:023 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!

 04:024:024 And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.

 04:024:025 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.

 04:025:001 And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.

 04:025:002 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.

 04:025:003 And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.

 04:025:004 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.

 04:025:005 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baalpeor.

 04:025:006 And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 04:025:007 And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;

 04:025:008 And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.

 04:025:009 And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.

 04:025:010 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:025:011 Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.

 04:025:012 Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:

 04:025:013 And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.

 04:025:014 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.

 04:025:015 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian.

 04:025:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:025:017 Vex the Midianites, and smite them:

 04:025:018 For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.

 04:026:001 And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,

 04:026:002 Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel.

 04:026:003 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,

 04:026:004 Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt.

 04:026:010 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign.

 04:026:052 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:026:053 Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.

 04:026:054 To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance: to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him.

 04:026:055 Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.

 04:026:056 According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided between many and few.

 04:026:057 And these are they that were numbered of the Levites after their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites: of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites: of Merari, the family of the Merarites.

 04:026:060 And unto Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

 04:026:061 And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before the LORD.

 04:026:062 And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, all males from a month old and upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.

 04:026:063 These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

 04:026:064 But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.

 04:026:065 For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

 04:027:001 Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.

 04:027:002 And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

 04:027:003 Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons.

 04:027:004 Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father.

 04:027:005 And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.

 04:027:006 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:027:007 The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.

 04:027:008 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.

 04:027:009 And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.

 04:027:010 And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren.

 04:027:011 And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses.

 04:027:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel.

 04:027:013 And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.

 04:027:014 For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.

 04:027:015 And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,

 04:027:016 Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,

 04:027:017 Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.

 04:027:018 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;

 04:027:019 And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.

 04:027:020 And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.

 04:027:021 And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.

 04:027:022 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:

 04:027:023 And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.

 04:028:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:028:002 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.

 04:028:003 And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering.

 04:028:004 The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;

 04:028:005 And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.

 04:028:006 It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

 04:028:007 And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering.

 04:028:008 And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

 04:028:009 And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:

 04:028:010 This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

 04:028:011 And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;

 04:028:012 And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;

 04:028:013 And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

 04:028:014 And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.

 04:028:015 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

 04:028:016 And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of the LORD.

 04:028:017 And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.

 04:028:018 In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work therein:

 04:028:019 But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without blemish:

 04:028:020 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram;

 04:028:021 A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

 04:028:022 And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.

 04:028:023 Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering.

 04:028:024 After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

 04:028:025 And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.

 04:028:026 Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD, after your weeks be out, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:

 04:028:027 But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year;

 04:028:028 And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram,

 04:028:029 A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs;

 04:028:030 And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.

 04:028:031 Ye shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish) and their drink offerings.

 04:029:001 And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you.

 04:029:002 And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year without blemish:

 04:029:003 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram,

 04:029:004 And one tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

 04:029:005 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you:

 04:029:006 Beside the burnt offering of the month, and his meat offering, and the daily burnt offering, and his meat offering, and their drink offerings, according unto their manner, for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

 04:029:007 And ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall not do any work therein:

 04:029:008 But ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet savour; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year; they shall be unto you without blemish:

 04:029:009 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals to a bullock, and two tenth deals to one ram,

 04:029:010 A several tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

 04:029:011 One kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the sin offering of atonement, and the continual burnt offering, and the meat offering of it, and their drink offerings.

 04:029:012 And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work, and ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days:

 04:029:013 And ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; thirteen young bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year; they shall be without blemish:

 04:029:017 And on the second day ye shall offer twelve young bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs of the first year without spot:

 04:029:018 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner:

 04:029:019 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, and the meat offering thereof, and their drink offerings.

 04:029:020 And on the third day eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish;

 04:029:021 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner:

 04:029:037 Their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullock, for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the manner:

 04:029:038 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.

 04:029:039 These things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set feasts, beside your vows, and your freewill offerings, for your burnt offerings, and for your meat offerings, and for your drink offerings, and for your peace offerings.

 04:029:040 And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.

 04:030:001 And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded.

 04:030:002 If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.

 04:030:003 If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth;

 04:030:004 And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.

 04:030:005 But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.

 04:030:006 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;

 04:030:007 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

 04:030:008 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.

 04:030:009 But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.

 04:030:010 And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;

 04:030:011 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

 04:030:012 But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.

 04:030:013 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.

 04:030:014 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.

 04:030:015 But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.

 04:030:016 These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house.

 04:031:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:031:002 Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.

 04:031:003 And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.

 04:031:004 Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.

 04:031:005 So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.

 04:031:006 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.

 04:031:007 And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.

 04:031:008 And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.

 04:031:009 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.

 04:031:010 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.

 04:031:011 And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.

 04:031:012 And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.

 04:031:013 And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.

 04:031:014 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.

 04:031:015 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?

 04:031:016 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.

 04:031:017 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.

 04:031:018 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.

 04:031:019 And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.

 04:031:020 And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.

 04:031:021 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses;

 04:031:022 Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,

 04:031:023 Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water.

 04:031:024 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.

 04:031:025 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:031:026 Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:

 04:031:027 And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:

 04:031:028 And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:

 04:031:029 Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD.

 04:031:030 And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.

 04:031:031 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.

 04:031:032 And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,

 04:031:033 And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,

 04:031:034 And threescore and one thousand asses,

 04:031:035 And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.

 04:031:036 And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:

 04:031:037 And the LORD's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.

 04:031:038 And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was threescore and twelve.

 04:031:039 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD's tribute was threescore and one.

 04:031:040 And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was thirty and two persons.

 04:031:041 And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.

 04:031:042 And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,

 04:031:043 (Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,

 04:031:044 And thirty and six thousand beeves,

 04:031:045 And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,

 04:031:046 And sixteen thousand persons;)

 04:031:047 Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.

 04:031:048 And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:

 04:031:049 And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.

 04:031:050 We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.

 04:031:051 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.

 04:031:052 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.

 04:031:053 (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)

 04:031:054 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.

 04:032:001 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;

 04:032:002 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,

 04:032:003 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,

 04:032:004 Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:

 04:032:005 Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.

 04:032:006 And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?

 04:032:007 And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?

 04:032:008 Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.

 04:032:009 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.

 04:032:010 And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying,

 04:032:011 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:

 04:032:012 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.

 04:032:013 And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.

 04:032:014 And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.

 04:032:015 For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.

 04:032:016 And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:

 04:032:017 But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.

 04:032:018 We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.

 04:032:019 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.

 04:032:020 And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war,

 04:032:021 And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,

 04:032:022 And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.

 04:032:023 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.

 04:032:024 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.

 04:032:025 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.

 04:032:026 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:

 04:032:027 But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the Lord to battle, as my lord saith.

 04:032:028 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:

 04:032:029 And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:

 04:032:030 But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.

 04:032:031 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.

 04:032:032 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be our's.

 04:032:033 And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about.

 04:032:034 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,

 04:032:035 And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,

 04:032:036 And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.

 04:032:037 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,

 04:032:038 And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.

 04:032:039 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.

 04:032:040 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.

 04:032:041 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.

 04:032:042 And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.

 04:033:001 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.

 04:033:002 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys according to their goings out.

 04:033:003 And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.

 04:033:004 For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments.

 04:033:005 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in Succoth.

 04:033:006 And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness.

 04:033:007 And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth, which is before Baalzephon: and they pitched before Migdol.

 04:033:008 And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.

 04:033:009 And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees; and they pitched there.

 04:033:010 And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.

 04:033:011 And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin.

 04:033:012 And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.

 04:033:013 And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.

 04:033:014 And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink.

 04:033:015 And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness of Sinai.

 04:033:016 And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at Kibrothhattaavah.

 04:033:017 And they departed from Kibrothhattaavah, and encamped at Hazeroth.

 04:033:018 And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah.

 04:033:019 And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmonparez.

 04:033:020 And they departed from Rimmonparez, and pitched in Libnah.

 04:033:021 And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah.

 04:033:022 And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah.

 04:033:023 And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher.

 04:033:024 And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah.

 04:033:025 And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth.

 04:033:026 And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.

 04:033:027 And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah.

 04:033:028 And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah.

 04:033:029 And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah.

 04:033:030 And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.

 04:033:031 And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.

 04:033:032 And they removed from Benejaakan, and encamped at Horhagidgad.

 04:033:033 And they went from Horhagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah.

 04:033:034 And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.

 04:033:035 And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber.

 04:033:036 And they removed from Eziongaber, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.

 04:033:037 And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.

 04:033:038 And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first day of the fifth month.

 04:033:039 And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor.

 04:033:040 And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.

 04:033:041 And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah.

 04:033:042 And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon.

 04:033:043 And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth.

 04:033:044 And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the border of Moab.

 04:033:045 And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibongad.

 04:033:046 And they removed from Dibongad, and encamped in Almondiblathaim.

 04:033:047 And they removed from Almondiblathaim, and pitched in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.

 04:033:048 And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

 04:033:049 And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.

 04:033:050 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,

 04:033:051 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

 04:033:052 Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:

 04:033:053 And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.

 04:033:054 And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.

 04:033:055 But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.

 04:033:056 Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them.

 04:034:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:034:002 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:)

 04:034:003 Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:

 04:034:004 And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:

 04:034:005 And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.

 04:034:006 And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border.

 04:034:007 And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor:

 04:034:008 From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:

 04:034:009 And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border.

 04:034:010 And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham:

 04:034:011 And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:

 04:034:012 And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about.

 04:034:013 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe:

 04:034:014 For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance:

 04:034:015 The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.

 04:034:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:034:017 These are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.

 04:034:018 And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance.

 04:034:019 And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

 04:034:020 And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.

 04:034:021 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.

 04:034:022 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli.

 04:034:023 The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.

 04:034:024 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.

 04:034:025 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.

 04:034:026 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan.

 04:034:027 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.

 04:034:028 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.

 04:034:029 These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

 04:035:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,

 04:035:002 Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.

 04:035:003 And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.

 04:035:004 And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.

 04:035:005 And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.

 04:035:006 And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.

 04:035:007 So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.

 04:035:008 And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.

 04:035:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

 04:035:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

 04:035:011 Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.

 04:035:012 And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.

 04:035:013 And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge.

 04:035:014 Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.

 04:035:015 These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.

 04:035:016 And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.

 04:035:017 And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.

 04:035:018 Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.

 04:035:019 The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.

 04:035:020 But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;

 04:035:021 Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.

 04:035:022 But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait,

 04:035:023 Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:

 04:035:024 Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments:

 04:035:025 And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.

 04:035:026 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;

 04:035:027 And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:

 04:035:028 Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.

 04:035:029 So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

 04:035:030 Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.

 04:035:031 Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.

 04:035:032 And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.

 04:035:033 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.

 04:035:034 Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.

 04:036:001 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:

 04:036:002 And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.

 04:036:003 And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.

 04:036:004 And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.

 04:036:005 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.

 04:036:006 This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.

 04:036:007 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

 04:036:008 And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.

 04:036:009 Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.

 04:036:010 Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:

 04:036:011 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons:

 04:036:012 And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.

 04:036:013 These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

 Book 05 Deuteronomy

 05:001:001 These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.

 05:001:002 (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)

 05:001:003 And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;

 05:001:004 After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:

 05:001:005 On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,

 05:001:006 The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:

 05:001:007 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.

 05:001:008 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.

 05:001:009 And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:

 05:001:010 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.

 05:001:011 (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)

 05:001:012 How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?

 05:001:013 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.

 05:001:014 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.

 05:001:015 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.

 05:001:016 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.

 05:001:017 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.

 05:001:018 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.

 05:001:019 And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.

 05:001:020 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.

 05:001:021 Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.

 05:001:022 And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.

 05:001:023 And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:

 05:001:024 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.

 05:001:025 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.

 05:001:026 Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:

 05:001:027 And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.

 05:001:028 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.

 05:001:029 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.

 05:001:030 The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;

 05:001:031 And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.

 05:001:032 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,

 05:001:033 Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.

 05:001:034 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,

 05:001:035 Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers.

 05:001:036 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.

 05:001:037 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.

 05:001:038 But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.

 05:001:039 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.

 05:001:040 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.

 05:001:041 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.

 05:001:042 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.

 05:001:043 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.

 05:001:044 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.

 05:001:045 And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.

 05:001:046 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.

 05:002:001 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.

 05:002:002 And the LORD spake unto me, saying,

 05:002:003 Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.

 05:002:004 And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:

 05:002:005 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.

 05:002:006 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.

 05:002:007 For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.

 05:002:008 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.

 05:002:009 And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.

 05:002:010 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;

 05:002:011 Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.

 05:002:012 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.

 05:002:013 Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.

 05:002:014 And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.

 05:002:015 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.

 05:002:016 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,

 05:002:017 That the LORD spake unto me, saying,

 05:002:018 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:

 05:002:019 And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.

 05:002:020 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;

 05:002:021 A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:

 05:002:022 As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:

 05:002:023 And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)

 05:002:024 Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.

 05:002:025 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.

 05:002:026 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,

 05:002:027 Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.

 05:002:028 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;

 05:002:029 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.

 05:002:030 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.

 05:002:031 And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.

 05:002:032 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.

 05:002:033 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.

 05:002:034 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:

 05:002:035 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.

 05:002:036 From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:

 05:002:037 Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.

 05:003:001 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.

 05:003:002 And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

 05:003:003 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.

 05:003:004 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

 05:003:005 All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.

 05:003:006 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.

 05:003:007 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.

 05:003:008 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;

 05:003:009 (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)

 05:003:010 All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

 05:003:011 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.

 05:003:012 And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.

 05:003:013 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.

 05:003:014 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.

 05:003:015 And I gave Gilead unto Machir.

 05:003:016 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;

 05:003:017 The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.

 05:003:018 And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.

 05:003:019 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;

 05:003:020 Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.

 05:003:021 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.

 05:003:022 Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.

 05:003:023 And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,

 05:003:024 O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?

 05:003:025 I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.

 05:003:026 But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.

 05:003:027 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

 05:003:028 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.

 05:003:029 So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.

 05:004:001 Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.

 05:004:002 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.

 05:004:003 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.

 05:004:004 But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.

 05:004:005 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.

 05:004:006 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.

 05:004:007 For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?

 05:004:008 And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?

 05:004:009 Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;

 05:004:010 Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.

 05:004:011 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.

 05:004:012 And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.

 05:004:013 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.

 05:004:014 And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.

 05:004:015 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:

 05:004:016 Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,

 05:004:017 The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,

 05:004:018 The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:

 05:004:019 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.

 05:004:020 But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.

 05:004:021 Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:

 05:004:022 But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.

 05:004:023 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.

 05:004:024 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.

 05:004:025 When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:

 05:004:026 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.

 05:004:027 And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.

 05:004:028 And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.

 05:004:029 But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.

 05:004:030 When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;

 05:004:031 (For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.

 05:004:032 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?

 05:004:033 Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?

 05:004:034 Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?

 05:004:035 Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him.

 05:004:036 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.

 05:004:037 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;

 05:004:038 To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.

 05:004:039 Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.

 05:004:040 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.

 05:004:041 Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;

 05:004:042 That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:

 05:004:043 Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.

 05:004:044 And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:

 05:004:045 These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt.

 05:004:046 On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt:

 05:004:047 And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;

 05:004:048 From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon,

 05:004:049 And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.

 05:005:001 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.

 05:005:002 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

 05:005:003 The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.

 05:005:004 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,

 05:005:005 (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,

 05:005:006 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

 05:005:007 Thou shalt have none other gods before me.

 05:005:008 Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:

 05:005:009 Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,

 05:005:010 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.

 05:005:011 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

 05:005:012 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee.

 05:005:013 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:

 05:005:014 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.

 05:005:015 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.

 05:005:016 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

 05:005:017 Thou shalt not kill.

 05:005:018 Neither shalt thou commit adultery.

 05:005:019 Neither shalt thou steal.

 05:005:020 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.

 05:005:021 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's.

 05:005:022 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.

 05:005:023 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;

 05:005:024 And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.

 05:005:025 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.

 05:005:026 For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?

 05:005:027 Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.

 05:005:028 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.

 05:005:029 O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!

 05:005:030 Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.

 05:005:031 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.

 05:005:032 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.

 05:005:033 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.

 05:006:001 Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:

 05:006:002 That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.

 05:006:003 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.

 05:006:004 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:

 05:006:005 And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

 05:006:006 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:

 05:006:007 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

 05:006:008 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.

 05:006:009 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.

 05:006:010 And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not,

 05:006:011 And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;

 05:006:012 Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

 05:006:013 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.

 05:006:014 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you;

 05:006:015 (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.

 05:006:016 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.

 05:006:017 Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.

 05:006:018 And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers.

 05:006:019 To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken.

 05:006:020 And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you?

 05:006:021 Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:

 05:006:022 And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:

 05:006:023 And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.

 05:006:024 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.

 05:006:025 And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.

 05:007:001 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;

 05:007:002 And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:

 05:007:003 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.

 05:007:004 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.

 05:007:005 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.

 05:007:006 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.

 05:007:007 The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people:

 05:007:008 But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

 05:007:009 Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;

 05:007:010 And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.

 05:007:011 Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.

 05:007:012 Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:

 05:007:013 And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.

 05:007:014 Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.

 05:007:015 And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.

 05:007:016 And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.

 05:007:017 If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?

 05:007:018 Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;

 05:007:019 The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.

 05:007:020 Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.

 05:007:021 Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.

 05:007:022 And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.

 05:007:023 But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.

 05:007:024 And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.

 05:007:025 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God.

 05:007:026 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.

 05:008:001 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.

 05:008:002 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.

 05:008:003 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.

 05:008:004 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.

 05:008:005 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.

 05:008:006 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.

 05:008:007 For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;

 05:008:008 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;

 05:008:009 A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.

 05:008:010 When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.

 05:008:011 Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:

 05:008:012 Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;

 05:008:013 And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;

 05:008:014 Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;

 05:008:015 Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;

 05:008:016 Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;

 05:008:017 And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.

 05:008:018 But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.

 05:008:019 And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.

 05:008:020 As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God.

 05:009:001 Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,

 05:009:002 A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak!

 05:009:003 Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.

 05:009:004 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.

 05:009:005 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

 05:009:006 Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.

 05:009:007 Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.

 05:009:008 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.

 05:009:009 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:

 05:009:010 And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.

 05:009:011 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.

 05:009:012 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.

 05:009:013 Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:

 05:009:014 Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.

 05:009:015 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.

 05:009:016 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.

 05:009:017 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.

 05:009:018 And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

 05:009:019 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.

 05:009:020 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.

 05:009:021 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.

 05:009:022 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.

 05:009:023 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.

 05:009:024 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.

 05:009:025 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.

 05:009:026 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.

 05:009:027 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:

 05:009:028 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.

 05:009:029 Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.

 05:010:001 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.

 05:010:002 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.

 05:010:003 And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.

 05:010:004 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.

 05:010:005 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.

 05:010:006 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.

 05:010:007 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.

 05:010:008 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.

 05:010:009 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.

 05:010:010 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.

 05:010:011 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.

 05:010:012 And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,

 05:010:013 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?

 05:010:014 Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy God, the earth also, with all that therein is.

 05:010:015 Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.

 05:010:016 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.

 05:010:017 For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:

 05:010:018 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.

 05:010:019 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

 05:010:020 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.

 05:010:021 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.

 05:010:022 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.

 05:011:001 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.

 05:011:002 And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,

 05:011:003 And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;

 05:011:004 And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day;

 05:011:005 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place;

 05:011:006 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:

 05:011:007 But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.

 05:011:008 Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;

 05:011:009 And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.

 05:011:010 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:

 05:011:011 But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:

 05:011:012 A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.

 05:011:013 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,

 05:011:014 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.

 05:011:015 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.

 05:011:016 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;

 05:011:017 And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.

 05:011:018 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.

 05:011:019 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

 05:011:020 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates:

 05:011:021 That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.

 05:011:022 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;

 05:011:023 Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.

 05:011:024 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.

 05:011:025 There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.

 05:011:026 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;

 05:011:027 A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:

 05:011:028 And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.

 05:011:029 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.

 05:011:030 Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?

 05:011:031 For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.

 05:011:032 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.

 05:012:001 These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.

 05:012:002 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:

 05:012:003 And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.

 05:012:004 Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.

 05:012:005 But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:

 05:012:006 And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:

 05:012:007 And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.

 05:012:008 Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.

 05:012:009 For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you.

 05:012:010 But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;

 05:012:011 Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:

 05:012:012 And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.

 05:012:013 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest:

 05:012:014 But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.

 05:012:015 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.

 05:012:016 Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water.

 05:012:017 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:

 05:012:018 But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.

 05:012:019 Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth.

 05:012:020 When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

 05:012:021 If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

 05:012:022 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.

 05:012:023 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.

 05:012:024 Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.

 05:012:025 Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.

 05:012:026 Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:

 05:012:027 And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.

 05:012:028 Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God.

 05:012:029 When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land;

 05:012:030 Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.

 05:012:031 Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.

 05:012:032 What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.

 05:013:001 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder,

 05:013:002 And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;

 05:013:003 Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.

 05:013:004 Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.

 05:013:005 And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.

 05:013:006 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;

 05:013:007 Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;

 05:013:008 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:

 05:013:009 But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.

 05:013:010 And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

 05:013:011 And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you.

 05:013:012 If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying,

 05:013:013 Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;

 05:013:014 Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you;

 05:013:015 Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.

 05:013:016 And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.

 05:013:017 And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;

 05:013:018 When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.

 05:014:001 Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.

 05:014:002 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations that are upon the earth.

 05:014:003 Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.

 05:014:004 These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,

 05:014:005 The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.

 05:014:006 And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat.

 05:014:007 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you.

 05:014:008 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.

 05:014:009 These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat:

 05:014:010 And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you.

 05:014:011 Of all clean birds ye shall eat.

 05:014:012 But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,

 05:014:013 And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,

 05:014:014 And every raven after his kind,

 05:014:015 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,

 05:014:016 The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,

 05:014:017 And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,

 05:014:018 And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.

 05:014:019 And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten.

 05:014:020 But of all clean fowls ye may eat.

 05:014:021 Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.

 05:014:022 Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year.

 05:014:023 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.

 05:014:024 And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:

 05:014:025 Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose:

 05:014:026 And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household,

 05:014:027 And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.

 05:014:028 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:

 05:014:029 And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest.

 05:015:001 At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.

 05:015:002 And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD's release.

 05:015:003 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;

 05:015:004 Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it:

 05:015:005 Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.

 05:015:006 For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.

 05:015:007 If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:

 05:015:008 But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.

 05:015:009 Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.

 05:015:010 Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.

 05:015:011 For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.

 05:015:012 And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.

 05:015:013 And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty:

 05:015:014 Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.

 05:015:015 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day.

 05:015:016 And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee;

 05:015:017 Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.

 05:015:018 It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee, in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest.

 05:015:019 All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.

 05:015:020 Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.

 05:015:021 And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God.

 05:015:022 Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.

 05:015:023 Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water.

 05:016:001 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.

 05:016:002 Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there.

 05:016:003 Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.

 05:016:004 And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.

 05:016:005 Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee:

 05:016:006 But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.

 05:016:007 And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents.

 05:016:008 Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work therein.

 05:016:009 Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn.

 05:016:010 And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:

 05:016:011 And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.

 05:016:012 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.

 05:016:013 Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:

 05:016:014 And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.

 05:016:015 Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.

 05:016:016 Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:

 05:016:017 Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.

 05:016:018 Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment.

 05:016:019 Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.

 05:016:020 That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

 05:016:021 Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.

 05:016:022 Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy God hateth.

 05:017:001 Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock, or sheep, wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that is an abomination unto the LORD thy God.

 05:017:002 If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant,

 05:017:003 And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;

 05:017:004 And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and enquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel:

 05:017:005 Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.

 05:017:006 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.

 05:017:007 The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put the evil away from among you.

 05:017:008 If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose;

 05:017:009 And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment:

 05:017:010 And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee:

 05:017:011 According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.

 05:017:012 And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.

 05:017:013 And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.

 05:017:014 When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;

 05:017:015 Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother.

 05:017:016 But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.

 05:017:017 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.

 05:017:018 And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites:

 05:017:019 And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:

 05:017:020 That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.

 05:018:001 The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.

 05:018:002 Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.

 05:018:003 And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.

 05:018:004 The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.

 05:018:005 For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.

 05:018:006 And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the LORD shall choose;

 05:018:007 Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the LORD.

 05:018:008 They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.

 05:018:009 When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.

 05:018:010 There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.

 05:018:011 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.

 05:018:012 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee.

 05:018:013 Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.

 05:018:014 For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.

 05:018:015 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;

 05:018:016 According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.

 05:018:017 And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken.

 05:018:018 I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.

 05:018:019 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.

 05:018:020 But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.

 05:018:021 And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?

 05:018:022 When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.

 05:019:001 When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;

 05:019:002 Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.

 05:019:003 Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.

 05:019:004 And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;

 05:019:005 As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live:

 05:019:006 Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.

 05:019:007 Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.

 05:019:008 And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers;

 05:019:009 If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three:

 05:019:010 That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.

 05:019:011 But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities:

 05:019:012 Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.

 05:019:013 Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.

 05:019:014 Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.

 05:019:015 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.

 05:019:016 If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong;

 05:019:017 Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days;

 05:019:018 And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother;

 05:019:019 Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.

 05:019:020 And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.

 05:019:021 And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

 05:020:001 When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the LORD thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

 05:020:002 And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,

 05:020:003 And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;

 05:020:004 For the LORD your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.

 05:020:005 And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.

 05:020:006 And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.

 05:020:007 And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.

 05:020:008 And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart.

 05:020:009 And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.

 05:020:010 When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.

 05:020:011 And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.

 05:020:012 And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:

 05:020:013 And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:

 05:020:014 But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.

 05:020:015 Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.

 05:020:016 But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:

 05:020:017 But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:

 05:020:018 That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God.

 05:020:019 When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:

 05:020:020 Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.

 05:021:001 If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath slain him:

 05:021:002 Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:

 05:021:003 And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;

 05:021:004 And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley:

 05:021:005 And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried:

 05:021:006 And all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:

 05:021:007 And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.

 05:021:008 Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.

 05:021:009 So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.

 05:021:010 When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive,

 05:021:011 And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;

 05:021:012 Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house, and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;

 05:021:013 And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.

 05:021:014 And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.

 05:021:015 If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:

 05:021:016 Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn:

 05:021:017 But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.

 05:021:018 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:

 05:021:019 Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;

 05:021:020 And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.

 05:021:021 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.

 05:021:022 And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:

 05:021:023 His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.

 05:022:001 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother.

 05:022:002 And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again.

 05:022:003 In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.

 05:022:004 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again.

 05:022:005 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.

 05:022:006 If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:

 05:022:007 But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days.

 05:022:008 When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall from thence.

 05:022:009 Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled.

 05:022:010 Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.

 05:022:011 Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen and linen together.

 05:022:012 Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.

 05:022:013 If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,

 05:022:014 And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid:

 05:022:015 Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate:

 05:022:016 And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;

 05:022:017 And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.

 05:022:018 And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;

 05:022:019 And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.

 05:022:020 But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel:

 05:022:021 Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.

 05:022:022 If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.

 05:022:023 If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;

 05:022:024 Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you.

 05:022:025 But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die.

 05:022:026 But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter:

 05:022:027 For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.

 05:022:028 If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;

 05:022:029 Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.

 05:022:030 A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover his father's skirt.

 05:023:001 He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.

 05:023:002 A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD.

 05:023:003 An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:

 05:023:004 Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee.

 05:023:005 Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee.

 05:023:006 Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever.

 05:023:007 Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land.

 05:023:008 The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the LORD in their third generation.

 05:023:009 When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing.

 05:023:010 If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:

 05:023:011 But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again.

 05:023:012 Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad:

 05:023:013 And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:

 05:023:014 For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.

 05:023:015 Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee:

 05:023:016 He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress him.

 05:023:017 There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel.

 05:023:018 Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even both these are abomination unto the LORD thy God.

 05:023:019 Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:

 05:023:020 Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it.

 05:023:021 When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.

 05:023:022 But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.

 05:023:023 That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; even a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.

 05:023:024 When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel.

 05:023:025 When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn.

 05:024:001 When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.

 05:024:002 And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife.

 05:024:003 And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife;

 05:024:004 Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.

 05:024:005 When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.

 05:024:006 No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh a man's life to pledge.

 05:024:007 If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.

 05:024:008 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.

 05:024:009 Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.

 05:024:010 When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge.

 05:024:011 Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.

 05:024:012 And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:

 05:024:013 In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.

 05:024:014 Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates:

 05:024:015 At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee.

 05:024:016 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.

 05:024:017 Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:

 05:024:018 But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.

 05:024:019 When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.

 05:024:020 When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.

 05:024:021 When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.

 05:024:022 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.

 05:025:001 If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.

 05:025:002 And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.

 05:025:003 Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.

 05:025:004 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.

 05:025:005 If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her.

 05:025:006 And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of Israel.

 05:025:007 And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother.

 05:025:008 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;

 05:025:009 Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house.

 05:025:010 And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed.

 05:025:011 When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets:

 05:025:012 Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity her.

 05:025:013 Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small.

 05:025:014 Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small.

 05:025:015 But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

 05:025:016 For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the LORD thy God.

 05:025:017 Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt;

 05:025:018 How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.

 05:025:019 Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it.

 05:026:001 And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein;

 05:026:002 That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name there.

 05:026:003 And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God, that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to give us.

 05:026:004 And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God.

 05:026:005 And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:

 05:026:006 And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage:

 05:026:007 And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression:

 05:026:008 And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders:

 05:026:009 And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.

 05:026:010 And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God:

 05:026:011 And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that is among you.

 05:026:012 When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled;

 05:026:013 Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them.

 05:026:014 I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.

 05:026:015 Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.

 05:026:016 This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.

 05:026:017 Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice:

 05:026:018 And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments;

 05:026:019 And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.

 05:027:001 And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.

 05:027:002 And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaister them with plaister:

 05:027:003 And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee.

 05:027:004 Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaister them with plaister.

 05:027:005 And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them.

 05:027:006 Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones: and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God:

 05:027:007 And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and rejoice before the LORD thy God.

 05:027:008 And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.

 05:027:009 And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel, saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the people of the LORD thy God.

 05:027:010 Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day.

 05:027:011 And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,

 05:027:012 These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:

 05:027:013 And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

 05:027:014 And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice,

 05:027:015 Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.

 05:027:016 Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.

 05:027:017 Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen.

 05:027:018 Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen.

 05:027:019 Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.

 05:027:020 Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; because he uncovereth his father's skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen.

 05:027:021 Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say, Amen.

 05:027:022 Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.

 05:027:023 Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law. And all the people shall say, Amen.

 05:027:024 Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all the people shall say, Amen.

 05:027:025 Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person. And all the people shall say, Amen.

 05:027:026 Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.

 05:028:001 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:

 05:028:002 And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.

 05:028:003 Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field.

 05:028:004 Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.

 05:028:005 Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.

 05:028:006 Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out.

 05:028:007 The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way, and flee before thee seven ways.

 05:028:008 The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

 05:028:009 The LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as he hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, and walk in his ways.

 05:028:010 And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.

 05:028:011 And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give thee.

 05:028:012 The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow.

 05:028:013 And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them:

 05:028:014 And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.

 05:028:015 But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee:

 05:028:016 Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field.

 05:028:017 Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.

 05:028:018 Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.

 05:028:019 Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out.

 05:028:020 The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.

 05:028:021 The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess it.

 05:028:022 The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish.

 05:028:023 And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron.

 05:028:024 The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.

 05:028:025 The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies: thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.

 05:028:026 And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.

 05:028:027 The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed.

 05:028:028 The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart:

 05:028:029 And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save thee.

 05:028:030 Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof.

 05:028:031 Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them.

 05:028:032 Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long; and there shall be no might in thine hand.

 05:028:033 The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway:

 05:028:034 So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.

 05:028:035 The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head.

 05:028:036 The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.

 05:028:037 And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.

 05:028:038 Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.

 05:028:039 Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.

 05:028:040 Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his fruit.

 05:028:041 Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity.

 05:028:042 All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.

 05:028:043 The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high; and thou shalt come down very low.

 05:028:044 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.

 05:028:045 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:

 05:028:046 And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.

 05:028:047 Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;

 05:028:048 Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.

 05:028:049 The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand;

 05:028:050 A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:

 05:028:051 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.

 05:028:052 And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.

 05:028:053 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee:

 05:028:054 So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:

 05:028:055 So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.

 05:028:056 The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,

 05:028:057 And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.

 05:028:058 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;

 05:028:059 Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.

 05:028:060 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.

 05:028:061 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.

 05:028:062 And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God.

 05:028:063 And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.

 05:028:064 And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone.

 05:028:065 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:

 05:028:066 And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:

 05:028:067 In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.

 05:028:068 And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.

 05:029:001 These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.

 05:029:002 And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;

 05:029:003 The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles:

 05:029:004 Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.

 05:029:005 And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot.

 05:029:006 Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God.

 05:029:007 And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:

 05:029:008 And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.

 05:029:009 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.

 05:029:010 Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel,

 05:029:011 Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:

 05:029:012 That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day:

 05:029:013 That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

 05:029:014 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;

 05:029:015 But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:

 05:029:016 (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by;

 05:029:017 And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)

 05:029:018 Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;

 05:029:019 And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:

 05:029:020 The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.

 05:029:021 And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law:

 05:029:022 So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it;

 05:029:023 And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:

 05:029:024 Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?

 05:029:025 Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:

 05:029:026 For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:

 05:029:027 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:

 05:029:028 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.

 05:029:029 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.

 05:030:001 And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee,

 05:030:002 And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;

 05:030:003 That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.

 05:030:004 If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:

 05:030:005 And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.

 05:030:006 And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.

 05:030:007 And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.

 05:030:008 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.

 05:030:009 And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers:

 05:030:010 If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.

 05:030:011 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.

 05:030:012 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?

 05:030:013 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?

 05:030:014 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.

 05:030:015 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;

 05:030:016 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.

 05:030:017 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;

 05:030:018 I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.

 05:030:019 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:

 05:030:020 That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

 05:031:001 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.

 05:031:002 And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

 05:031:003 The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.

 05:031:004 And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.

 05:031:005 And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.

 05:031:006 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

 05:031:007 And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.

 05:031:008 And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.

 05:031:009 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.

 05:031:010 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,

 05:031:011 When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.

 05:031:012 Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:

 05:031:013 And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

 05:031:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.

 05:031:015 And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.

 05:031:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.

 05:031:017 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?

 05:031:018 And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.

 05:031:019 Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.

 05:031:020 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.

 05:031:021 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.

 05:031:022 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.

 05:031:023 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.

 05:031:024 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,

 05:031:025 That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,

 05:031:026 Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.

 05:031:027 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?

 05:031:028 Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.

 05:031:029 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.

 05:031:030 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.

 05:032:001 Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.

 05:032:002 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:

 05:032:003 Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.

 05:032:004 He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.

 05:032:005 They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.

 05:032:006 Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?

 05:032:007 Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.

 05:032:008 When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.

 05:032:009 For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.

 05:032:010 He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.

 05:032:011 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:

 05:032:012 So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.

 05:032:013 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;

 05:032:014 Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.

 05:032:015 But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.

 05:032:016 They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.

 05:032:017 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.

 05:032:018 Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.

 05:032:019 And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.

 05:032:020 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.

 05:032:021 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.

 05:032:022 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.

 05:032:023 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.

 05:032:024 They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.

 05:032:025 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.

 05:032:026 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:

 05:032:027 Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this.

 05:032:028 For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.

 05:032:029 O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!

 05:032:030 How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?

 05:032:031 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.

 05:032:032 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:

 05:032:033 Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.

 05:032:034 Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?

 05:032:035 To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.

 05:032:036 For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.

 05:032:037 And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,

 05:032:038 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.

 05:032:039 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.

 05:032:040 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.

 05:032:041 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.

 05:032:042 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.

 05:032:043 Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.

 05:032:044 And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.

 05:032:045 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:

 05:032:046 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.

 05:032:047 For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

 05:032:048 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,

 05:032:049 Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:

 05:032:050 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:

 05:032:051 Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.

 05:032:052 Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.

 05:033:001 And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.

 05:033:002 And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.

 05:033:003 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.

 05:033:004 Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.

 05:033:005 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.

 05:033:006 Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.

 05:033:007 And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.

 05:033:008 And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;

 05:033:009 Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.

 05:033:010 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.

 05:033:011 Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.

 05:033:012 And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.

 05:033:013 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,

 05:033:014 And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,

 05:033:015 And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,

 05:033:016 And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.

 05:033:017 His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.

 05:033:018 And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents.

 05:033:019 They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.

 05:033:020 And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.

 05:033:021 And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.

 05:033:022 And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.

 05:033:023 And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south.

 05:033:024 And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.

 05:033:025 Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.

 05:033:026 There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.

 05:033:027 The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.

 05:033:028 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.

 05:033:029 Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.

 05:034:001 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,

 05:034:002 And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,

 05:034:003 And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.

 05:034:004 And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.

 05:034:005 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.

 05:034:006 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.

 05:034:007 And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.

 05:034:008 And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.

 05:034:009 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.

 05:034:010 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,

 05:034:011 In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,

 05:034:012 And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.

 Book 06 Joshua

 06:001:001 Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,

 06:001:002 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.

 06:001:003 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.

 06:001:004 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.

 06:001:005 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

 06:001:006 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.

 06:001:007 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest.

 06:001:008 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.

 06:001:009 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.

 06:001:010 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,

 06:001:011 Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.

 06:001:012 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,

 06:001:013 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.

 06:001:014 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;

 06:001:015 Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.

 06:001:016 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.

 06:001:017 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.

 06:001:018 Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.

 06:002:001 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.

 06:002:002 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.

 06:002:003 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.

 06:002:004 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:

 06:002:005 And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.

 06:002:006 But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.

 06:002:007 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.

 06:002:008 And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;

 06:002:009 And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.

 06:002:010 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.

 06:002:011 And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.

 06:002:012 Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token:

 06:002:013 And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.

 06:002:014 And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.

 06:002:015 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.

 06:002:016 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.

 06:002:017 And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.

 06:002:018 Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.

 06:002:019 And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.

 06:002:020 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.

 06:002:021 And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.

 06:002:022 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.

 06:002:023 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:

 06:002:024 And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.

 06:003:001 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.

 06:003:002 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;

 06:003:003 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.

 06:003:004 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.

 06:003:005 And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.

 06:003:006 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.

 06:003:007 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.

 06:003:008 And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.

 06:003:009 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.

 06:003:010 And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.

 06:003:011 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.

 06:003:012 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.

 06:003:013 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.

 06:003:014 And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;

 06:003:015 And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)

 06:003:016 That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.

 06:003:017 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.

 06:004:001 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,

 06:004:002 Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,

 06:004:003 And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.

 06:004:004 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:

 06:004:005 And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:

 06:004:006 That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?

 06:004:007 Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.

 06:004:008 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.

 06:004:009 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.

 06:004:010 For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.

 06:004:011 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.

 06:004:012 And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:

 06:004:013 About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.

 06:004:014 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.

 06:004:015 And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,

 06:004:016 Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.

 06:004:017 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.

 06:004:018 And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did before.

 06:004:019 And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.

 06:004:020 And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.

 06:004:021 And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?

 06:004:022 Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.

 06:004:023 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:

 06:004:024 That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.

 06:005:001 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.

 06:005:002 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.

 06:005:003 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.

 06:005:004 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.

 06:005:005 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.

 06:005:006 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.

 06:005:007 And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.

 06:005:008 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.

 06:005:009 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.

 06:005:010 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.

 06:005:011 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.

 06:005:012 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.

 06:005:013 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?

 06:005:014 And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his servant?

 06:005:015 And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.

 06:006:001 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.

 06:006:002 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.

 06:006:003 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.

 06:006:004 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.

 06:006:005 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.

 06:006:006 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.

 06:006:007 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.

 06:006:008 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.

 06:006:009 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.

 06:006:010 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.

 06:006:011 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.

 06:006:012 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.

 06:006:013 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.

 06:006:014 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.

 06:006:015 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.

 06:006:016 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.

 06:006:017 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.

 06:006:018 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.

 06:006:019 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.

 06:006:020 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.

 06:006:021 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.

 06:006:022 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.

 06:006:023 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.

 06:006:024 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.

 06:006:025 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

 06:006:026 And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.

 06:006:027 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.

 06:007:001 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.

 06:007:002 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.

 06:007:003 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few.

 06:007:004 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.

 06:007:005 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.

 06:007:006 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.

 06:007:007 And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!

 06:007:008 O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!

 06:007:009 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?

 06:007:010 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?

 06:007:011 Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.

 06:007:012 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.

 06:007:013 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.

 06:007:014 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.

 06:007:015 And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.

 06:007:016 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:

 06:007:017 And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:

 06:007:018 And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.

 06:007:019 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.

 06:007:020 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:

 06:007:021 When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.

 06:007:022 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.

 06:007:023 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.

 06:007:024 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.

 06:007:025 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.

 06:007:026 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.

 06:008:001 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:

 06:008:002 And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.

 06:008:003 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.

 06:008:004 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:

 06:008:005 And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,

 06:008:006 (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.

 06:008:007 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.

 06:008:008 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.

 06:008:009 Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.

 06:008:010 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.

 06:008:011 And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.

 06:008:012 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

 06:008:013 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.

 06:008:014 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.

 06:008:015 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.

 06:008:016 And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.

 06:008:017 And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.

 06:008:018 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.

 06:008:019 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.

 06:008:020 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.

 06:008:021 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.

 06:008:022 And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.

 06:008:023 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.

 06:008:024 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.

 06:008:025 And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.

 06:008:026 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.

 06:008:027 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.

 06:008:028 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day.

 06:008:029 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.

 06:008:030 Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,

 06:008:031 As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.

 06:008:032 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.

 06:008:033 And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.

 06:008:034 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.

 06:008:035 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.

 06:009:001 And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;

 06:009:002 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.

 06:009:003 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,

 06:009:004 They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;

 06:009:005 And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy.

 06:009:006 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.

 06:009:007 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?

 06:009:008 And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?

 06:009:009 And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,

 06:009:010 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.

 06:009:011 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us.

 06:009:012 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:

 06:009:013 And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.

 06:009:014 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.

 06:009:015 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.

 06:009:016 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.

 06:009:017 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.

 06:009:018 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.

 06:009:019 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.

 06:009:020 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.

 06:009:021 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.

 06:009:022 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?

 06:009:023 Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.

 06:009:024 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.

 06:009:025 And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.

 06:009:026 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.

 06:009:027 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.

 06:010:001 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;

 06:010:002 That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.

 06:010:003 Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,

 06:010:004 Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.

 06:010:005 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.

 06:010:006 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.

 06:010:007 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.

 06:010:008 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.

 06:010:009 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night.

 06:010:010 And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.

 06:010:011 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.

 06:010:012 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.

 06:010:013 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.

 06:010:014 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.

 06:010:015 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.

 06:010:016 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.

 06:010:017 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.

 06:010:018 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:

 06:010:019 And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.

 06:010:020 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.

 06:010:021 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.

 06:010:022 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.

 06:010:023 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.

 06:010:024 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.

 06:010:025 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.

 06:010:026 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.

 06:010:027 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.

 06:010:028 And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.

 06:010:029 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:

 06:010:030 And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.

 06:010:031 And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:

 06:010:032 And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.

 06:010:033 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.

 06:010:034 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:

 06:010:035 And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.

 06:010:036 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:

 06:010:037 And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.

 06:010:038 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:

 06:010:039 And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.

 06:010:040 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.

 06:010:041 And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.

 06:010:042 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.

 06:010:043 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.

 06:011:001 And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,

 06:011:002 And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,

 06:011:003 And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.

 06:011:004 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.

 06:011:005 And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.

 06:011:006 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.

 06:011:007 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.

 06:011:008 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.

 06:011:009 And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.

 06:011:010 And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.

 06:011:011 And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.

 06:011:012 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.

 06:011:013 But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.

 06:011:014 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.

 06:011:015 As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.

 06:011:016 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;

 06:011:017 Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.

 06:011:018 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.

 06:011:019 There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.

 06:011:020 For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.

 06:011:021 And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.

 06:011:022 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.

 06:011:023 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.

 06:012:001 Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:

 06:012:002 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;

 06:012:003 And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:

 06:012:004 And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,

 06:012:005 And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.

 06:012:006 Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.

 06:012:007 And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;

 06:012:008 In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:

 06:012:009 The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;

 06:012:010 The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;

 06:012:011 The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

 06:012:012 The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;

 06:012:013 The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;

 06:012:014 The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;

 06:012:015 The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;

 06:012:016 The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;

 06:012:017 The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;

 06:012:018 The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;

 06:012:019 The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;

 06:012:020 The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;

 06:012:021 The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;

 06:012:022 The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;

 06:012:023 The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of Gilgal, one;

 06:012:024 The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.

 06:013:001 Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.

 06:013:002 This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,

 06:013:003 From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:

 06:013:004 From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:

 06:013:005 And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath.

 06:013:006 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.

 06:013:007 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,

 06:013:008 With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;

 06:013:009 From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;

 06:013:010 And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;

 06:013:011 And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;

 06:013:012 All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out.

 06:013:013 Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.

 06:013:014 Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said unto them.

 06:013:015 And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families.

 06:013:016 And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba;

 06:013:017 Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,

 06:013:018 And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,

 06:013:019 And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of the valley,

 06:013:020 And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,

 06:013:021 And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.

 06:013:022 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.

 06:013:023 And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof.

 06:013:024 And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the children of Gad according to their families.

 06:013:025 And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah;

 06:013:026 And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;

 06:013:027 And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.

 06:013:028 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages.

 06:013:029 And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.

 06:013:030 And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities:

 06:013:031 And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families.

 06:013:032 These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.

 06:013:033 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them.

 06:014:001 And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.

 06:014:002 By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.

 06:014:003 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.

 06:014:004 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.

 06:014:005 As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.

 06:014:006 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea.

 06:014:007 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart.

 06:014:008 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.

 06:014:009 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.

 06:014:010 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.

 06:014:011 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.

 06:014:012 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.

 06:014:013 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.

 06:014:014 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.

 06:014:015 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.

 06:015:001 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.

 06:015:002 And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward:

 06:015:003 And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:

 06:015:004 From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.

 06:015:005 And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of Jordan. And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:

 06:015:006 And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:

 06:015:007 And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel:

 06:015:008 And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:

 06:015:009 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim:

 06:015:010 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:

 06:015:011 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.

 06:015:012 And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families.

 06:015:013 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.

 06:015:014 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.

 06:015:015 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.

 06:015:016 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

 06:015:017 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

 06:015:018 And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?

 06:015:019 Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.

 06:015:020 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.

 06:015:021 And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,

 06:015:022 And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,

 06:015:023 And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,

 06:015:024 Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,

 06:015:025 And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor,

 06:015:026 Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,

 06:015:027 And Hazargaddah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet,

 06:015:028 And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah,

 06:015:029 Baalah, and Iim, and Azem,

 06:015:030 And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,

 06:015:031 And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,

 06:015:032 And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty and nine, with their villages:

 06:015:033 And in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,

 06:015:034 And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam,

 06:015:035 Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,

 06:015:036 And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages:

 06:015:037 Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad,

 06:015:038 And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,

 06:015:039 Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,

 06:015:040 And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,

 06:015:041 And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages:

 06:015:042 Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,

 06:015:043 And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,

 06:015:044 And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages:

 06:015:045 Ekron, with her towns and her villages:

 06:015:046 From Ekron even unto the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with their villages:

 06:015:047 Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border thereof:

 06:015:048 And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,

 06:015:049 And Dannah, and Kirjathsannah, which is Debir,

 06:015:050 And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,

 06:015:051 And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages:

 06:015:052 Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,

 06:015:053 And Janum, and Bethtappuah, and Aphekah,

 06:015:054 And Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, and Zior; nine cities with their villages:

 06:015:055 Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,

 06:015:056 And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,

 06:015:057 Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages:

 06:015:058 Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor,

 06:015:059 And Maarath, and Bethanoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages:

 06:015:060 Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages:

 06:015:061 In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,

 06:015:062 And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with their villages.

 06:015:063 As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.

 06:016:001 And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel,

 06:016:002 And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth,

 06:016:003 And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings out thereof are at the sea.

 06:016:004 So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.

 06:016:005 And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper;

 06:016:006 And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;

 06:016:007 And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.

 06:016:008 The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.

 06:016:009 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.

 06:016:010 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under tribute.

 06:017:001 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.

 06:017:002 There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.

 06:017:003 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

 06:017:004 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.

 06:017:005 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;

 06:017:006 Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.

 06:017:007 And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of Entappuah.

 06:017:008 Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;

 06:017:009 And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:

 06:017:010 Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.

 06:017:011 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.

 06:017:012 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.

 06:017:013 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly drive them out.

 06:017:014 And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?

 06:017:015 And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get thee up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.

 06:017:016 And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.

 06:017:017 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only:

 06:017:018 But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong.

 06:018:001 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.

 06:018:002 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.

 06:018:003 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?

 06:018:004 Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to me.

 06:018:005 And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north.

 06:018:006 Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.

 06:018:007 But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.

 06:018:008 And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.

 06:018:009 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.

 06:018:010 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions.

 06:018:011 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.

 06:018:012 And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven.

 06:018:013 And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether Bethhoron.

 06:018:014 And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter.

 06:018:015 And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah:

 06:018:016 And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,

 06:018:017 And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,

 06:018:018 And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah:

 06:018:019 And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the south coast.

 06:018:020 And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to their families.

 06:018:021 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz,

 06:018:022 And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,

 06:018:023 And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah,

 06:018:024 And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages:

 06:018:025 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,

 06:018:026 And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,

 06:018:027 And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,

 06:018:028 And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.

 06:019:001 And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.

 06:019:002 And they had in their inheritance Beersheba, and Sheba, and Moladah,

 06:019:003 And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem,

 06:019:004 And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,

 06:019:005 And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah,

 06:019:006 And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their villages:

 06:019:007 Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their villages:

 06:019:008 And all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.

 06:019:009 Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them.

 06:019:010 And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families: and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid:

 06:019:011 And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before Jokneam;

 06:019:012 And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chislothtabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and goeth up to Japhia,

 06:019:013 And from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittahhepher, to Ittahkazin, and goeth out to Remmonmethoar to Neah;

 06:019:014 And the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon: and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthahel:

 06:019:015 And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.

 06:019:016 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.

 06:019:017 And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of Issachar according to their families.

 06:019:018 And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,

 06:019:019 And Haphraim, and Shihon, and Anaharath,

 06:019:020 And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,

 06:019:021 And Remeth, and Engannim, and Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez;

 06:019:022 And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.

 06:019:023 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages.

 06:019:024 And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.

 06:019:025 And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,

 06:019:026 And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath;

 06:019:027 And turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon, and reacheth to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand,

 06:019:028 And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great Zidon;

 06:019:029 And then the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:

 06:019:030 Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages.

 06:019:031 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.

 06:019:032 The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.

 06:019:033 And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings thereof were at Jordan:

 06:019:034 And then the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor, and goeth out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising.

 06:019:035 And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,

 06:019:036 And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,

 06:019:037 And Kedesh, and Edrei, and Enhazor,

 06:019:038 And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and Bethanath, and Bethshemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.

 06:019:039 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages.

 06:019:040 And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.

 06:019:041 And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Irshemesh,

 06:019:042 And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,

 06:019:043 And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,

 06:019:044 And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,

 06:019:045 And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon,

 06:019:046 And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.

 06:019:047 And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.

 06:019:048 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.

 06:019:049 When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:

 06:019:050 According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein.

 06:019:051 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country.

 06:020:001 The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying,

 06:020:002 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses:

 06:020:003 That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.

 06:020:004 And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.

 06:020:005 And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.

 06:020:006 And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.

 06:020:007 And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.

 06:020:008 And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.

 06:020:009 These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.

 06:021:001 Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel;

 06:021:002 And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.

 06:021:003 And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their suburbs.

 06:021:004 And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.

 06:021:005 And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.

 06:021:006 And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.

 06:021:007 The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.

 06:021:008 And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.

 06:021:009 And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name.

 06:021:010 Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs was the first lot.

 06:021:011 And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it.

 06:021:012 But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.

 06:021:013 Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with her suburbs,

 06:021:014 And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,

 06:021:015 And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,

 06:021:016 And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.

 06:021:017 And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with her suburbs,

 06:021:018 Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities.

 06:021:019 All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.

 06:021:020 And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.

 06:021:021 For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs,

 06:021:022 And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs; four cities.

 06:021:023 And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon with her suburbs,

 06:021:024 Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathrimmon with her suburbs; four cities.

 06:021:025 And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbs, and Gathrimmon with her suburbs; two cities.

 06:021:026 All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of the children of Kohath that remained.

 06:021:027 And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Beeshterah with her suburbs; two cities.

 06:021:028 And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs, Dabareh with her suburbs,

 06:021:029 Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannim with her suburbs; four cities.

 06:021:030 And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon with her suburbs,

 06:021:031 Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four cities.

 06:021:032 And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.

 06:021:033 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs.

 06:021:034 And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs,

 06:021:035 Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four cities.

 06:021:036 And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jahazah with her suburbs,

 06:021:037 Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four cities.

 06:021:038 And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with her suburbs,

 06:021:039 Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in all.

 06:021:040 So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities.

 06:021:041 All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.

 06:021:042 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus were all these cities.

 06:021:043 And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.

 06:021:044 And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.

 06:021:045 There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.

 06:022:001 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,

 06:022:002 And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:

 06:022:003 Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.

 06:022:004 And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.

 06:022:005 But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.

 06:022:006 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents.

 06:022:007 Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them,

 06:022:008 And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.

 06:022:009 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

 06:022:010 And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.

 06:022:011 And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.

 06:022:012 And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.

 06:022:013 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,

 06:022:014 And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.

 06:022:015 And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,

 06:022:016 Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD?

 06:022:017 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,

 06:022:018 But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.

 06:022:019 Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God.

 06:022:020 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.

 06:022:021 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,

 06:022:022 The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)

 06:022:023 That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it;

 06:022:024 And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?

 06:022:025 For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.

 06:022:026 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:

 06:022:027 But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD.

 06:022:028 Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.

 06:022:029 God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.

 06:022:030 And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.

 06:022:031 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.

 06:022:032 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.

 06:022:033 And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.

 06:022:034 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.

 06:023:001 And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age.

 06:023:002 And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age:

 06:023:003 And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.

 06:023:004 Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.

 06:023:005 And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.

 06:023:006 Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;

 06:023:007 That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:

 06:023:008 But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day.

 06:023:009 For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day.

 06:023:010 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.

 06:023:011 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God.

 06:023:012 Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:

 06:023:013 Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.

 06:023:014 And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.

 06:023:015 Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.

 06:023:016 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.

 06:024:001 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.

 06:024:002 And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.

 06:024:003 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.

 06:024:004 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.

 06:024:005 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.

 06:024:006 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.

 06:024:007 And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.

 06:024:008 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.

 06:024:009 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:

 06:024:010 But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.

 06:024:011 And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.

 06:024:012 And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.

 06:024:013 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.

 06:024:014 Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.

 06:024:015 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.

 06:024:016 And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;

 06:024:017 For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:

 06:024:018 And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.

 06:024:019 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.

 06:024:020 If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.

 06:024:021 And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.

 06:024:022 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.

 06:024:023 Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.

 06:024:024 And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.

 06:024:025 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

 06:024:026 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.

 06:024:027 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.

 06:024:028 So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.

 06:024:029 And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.

 06:024:030 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.

 06:024:031 And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.

 06:024:032 And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.

 06:024:033 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.

 Book 07 Judges

 07:001:001 Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?

 07:001:002 And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.

 07:001:003 And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.

 07:001:004 And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.

 07:001:005 And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.

 07:001:006 But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.

 07:001:007 And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.

 07:001:008 Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.

 07:001:009 And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.

 07:001:010 And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.

 07:001:011 And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:

 07:001:012 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

 07:001:013 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

 07:001:014 And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?

 07:001:015 And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.

 07:001:016 And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.

 07:001:017 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.

 07:001:018 Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.

 07:001:019 And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.

 07:001:020 And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.

 07:001:021 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.

 07:001:022 And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD was with them.

 07:001:023 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)

 07:001:024 And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.

 07:001:025 And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.

 07:001:026 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day.

 07:001:027 Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.

 07:001:028 And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.

 07:001:029 Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.

 07:001:030 Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.

 07:001:031 Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:

 07:001:032 But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.

 07:001:033 Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.

 07:001:034 And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:

 07:001:035 But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.

 07:001:036 And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.

 07:002:001 And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.

 07:002:002 And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?

 07:002:003 Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.

 07:002:004 And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.

 07:002:005 And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.

 07:002:006 And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.

 07:002:007 And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.

 07:002:008 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.

 07:002:009 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.

 07:002:010 And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.

 07:002:011 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:

 07:002:012 And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.

 07:002:013 And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.

 07:002:014 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.

 07:002:015 Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.

 07:002:016 Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.

 07:002:017 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.

 07:002:018 And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.

 07:002:019 And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.

 07:002:020 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;

 07:002:021 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:

 07:002:022 That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.

 07:002:023 Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.

 07:003:001 Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;

 07:003:002 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;

 07:003:003 Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.

 07:003:004 And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.

 07:003:005 And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:

 07:003:006 And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.

 07:003:007 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.

 07:003:008 Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.

 07:003:009 And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.

 07:003:010 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.

 07:003:011 And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.

 07:003:012 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.

 07:003:013 And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.

 07:003:014 So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.

 07:003:015 But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.

 07:003:016 But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.

 07:003:017 And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.

 07:003:018 And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.

 07:003:019 But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.

 07:003:020 And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.

 07:003:021 And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:

 07:003:022 And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.

 07:003:023 Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.

 07:003:024 When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.

 07:003:025 And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.

 07:003:026 And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.

 07:003:027 And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.

 07:003:028 And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.

 07:003:029 And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.

 07:003:030 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.

 07:003:031 And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.

 07:004:001 And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead.

 07:004:002 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.

 07:004:003 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.

 07:004:004 And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.

 07:004:005 And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.

 07:004:006 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?

 07:004:007 And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand.

 07:004:008 And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.

 07:004:009 And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.

 07:004:010 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.

 07:004:011 Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.

 07:004:012 And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.

 07:004:013 And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.

 07:004:014 And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.

 07:004:015 And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.

 07:004:016 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.

 07:004:017 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.

 07:004:018 And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.

 07:004:019 And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.

 07:004:020 Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.

 07:004:021 Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.

 07:004:022 And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.

 07:004:023 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.

 07:004:024 And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

 07:005:001 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,

 07:005:002 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.

 07:005:003 Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.

 07:005:004 LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.

 07:005:005 The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.

 07:005:006 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.

 07:005:007 The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.

 07:005:008 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?

 07:005:009 My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.

 07:005:010 Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.

 07:005:011 They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.

 07:005:012 Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.

 07:005:013 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.

 07:005:014 Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.

 07:005:015 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.

 07:005:016 Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.

 07:005:017 Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.

 07:005:018 Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.

 07:005:019 The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.

 07:005:020 They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.

 07:005:021 The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.

 07:005:022 Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.

 07:005:023 Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.

 07:005:024 Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.

 07:005:025 He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.

 07:005:026 She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.

 07:005:027 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.

 07:005:028 The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?

 07:005:029 Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,

 07:005:030 Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?

 07:005:031 So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.

 07:006:001 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.

 07:006:002 And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.

 07:006:003 And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;

 07:006:004 And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.

 07:006:005 For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.

 07:006:006 And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.

 07:006:007 And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites,

 07:006:008 That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;

 07:006:009 And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land;

 07:006:010 And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.

 07:006:011 And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.

 07:006:012 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.

 07:006:013 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.

 07:006:014 And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?

 07:006:015 And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.

 07:006:016 And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.

 07:006:017 And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.

 07:006:018 Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.

 07:006:019 And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.

 07:006:020 And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.

 07:006:021 Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.

 07:006:022 And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.

 07:006:023 And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.

 07:006:024 Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.

 07:006:025 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:

 07:006:026 And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.

 07:006:027 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.

 07:006:028 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.

 07:006:029 And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.

 07:006:030 Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.

 07:006:031 And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.

 07:006:032 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.

 07:006:033 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.

 07:006:034 But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.

 07:006:035 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.

 07:006:036 And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,

 07:006:037 Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.

 07:006:038 And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.

 07:006:039 And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.

 07:006:040 And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.

 07:007:001 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.

 07:007:002 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.

 07:007:003 Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.

 07:007:004 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.

 07:007:005 So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.

 07:007:006 And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.

 07:007:007 And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place.

 07:007:008 So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.

 07:007:009 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.

 07:007:010 But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:

 07:007:011 And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.

 07:007:012 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.

 07:007:013 And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.

 07:007:014 And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.

 07:007:015 And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.

 07:007:016 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.

 07:007:017 And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.

 07:007:018 When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

 07:007:019 So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.

 07:007:020 And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

 07:007:021 And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.

 07:007:022 And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.

 07:007:023 And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.

 07:007:024 And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.

 07:007:025 And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.

 07:008:001 And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.

 07:008:002 And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?

 07:008:003 God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.

 07:008:004 And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.

 07:008:005 And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.

 07:008:006 And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?

 07:008:007 And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.

 07:008:008 And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.

 07:008:009 And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.

 07:008:010 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.

 07:008:011 And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure.

 07:008:012 And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.

 07:008:013 And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,

 07:008:014 And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.

 07:008:015 And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?

 07:008:016 And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.

 07:008:017 And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.

 07:008:018 Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.

 07:008:019 And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.

 07:008:020 And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.

 07:008:021 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.

 07:008:022 Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.

 07:008:023 And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.

 07:008:024 And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)

 07:008:025 And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.

 07:008:026 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks.

 07:008:027 And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.

 07:008:028 Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.

 07:008:029 And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.

 07:008:030 And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.

 07:008:031 And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.

 07:008:032 And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.

 07:008:033 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.

 07:008:034 And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:

 07:008:035 Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.

 07:009:001 And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,

 07:009:002 Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.

 07:009:003 And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.

 07:009:004 And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.

 07:009:005 And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.

 07:009:006 And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.

 07:009:007 And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.

 07:009:008 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.

 07:009:009 But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?

 07:009:010 And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.

 07:009:011 But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?

 07:009:012 Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.

 07:009:013 And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?

 07:009:014 Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.

 07:009:015 And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.

 07:009:016 Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;

 07:009:017 (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:

 07:009:018 And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)

 07:009:019 If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:

 07:009:020 But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.

 07:009:021 And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.

 07:009:022 When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,

 07:009:023 Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:

 07:009:024 That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren.

 07:009:025 And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.

 07:009:026 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.

 07:009:027 And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.

 07:009:028 And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?

 07:009:029 And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.

 07:009:030 And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.

 07:009:031 And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee.

 07:009:032 Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee, and lie in wait in the field:

 07:009:033 And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.

 07:009:034 And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.

 07:009:035 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait.

 07:009:036 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.

 07:009:037 And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.

 07:009:038 Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.

 07:009:039 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.

 07:009:040 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.

 07:009:041 And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.

 07:009:042 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.

 07:009:043 And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.

 07:009:044 And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.

 07:009:045 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.

 07:009:046 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.

 07:009:047 And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.

 07:009:048 And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.

 07:009:049 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.

 07:009:050 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.

 07:009:051 But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.

 07:009:052 And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.

 07:009:053 And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.

 07:009:054 Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.

 07:009:055 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.

 07:009:056 Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:

 07:009:057 And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.

 07:010:001 And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.

 07:010:002 And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.

 07:010:003 And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.

 07:010:004 And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead.

 07:010:005 And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.

 07:010:006 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.

 07:010:007 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.

 07:010:008 And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.

 07:010:009 Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.

 07:010:010 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.

 07:010:011 And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?

 07:010:012 The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.

 07:010:013 Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more.

 07:010:014 Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.

 07:010:015 And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day.

 07:010:016 And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.

 07:010:017 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.

 07:010:018 And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

 07:011:001 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.

 07:011:002 And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a strange woman.

 07:011:003 Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.

 07:011:004 And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.

 07:011:005 And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:

 07:011:006 And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.

 07:011:007 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?

 07:011:008 And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

 07:011:009 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?

 07:011:010 And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.

 07:011:011 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.

 07:011:012 And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land?

 07:011:013 And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.

 07:011:014 And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:

 07:011:015 And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:

 07:011:016 But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;

 07:011:017 Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh.

 07:011:018 Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.

 07:011:019 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.

 07:011:020 But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.

 07:011:021 And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.

 07:011:022 And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.

 07:011:023 So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?

 07:011:024 Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.

 07:011:025 And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,

 07:011:026 While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?

 07:011:027 Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.

 07:011:028 Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.

 07:011:029 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.

 07:011:030 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,

 07:011:031 Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.

 07:011:032 So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.

 07:011:033 And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.

 07:011:034 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.

 07:011:035 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.

 07:011:036 And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.

 07:011:037 And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.

 07:011:038 And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.

 07:011:039 And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,

 07:011:040 That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.

 07:012:001 And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.

 07:012:002 And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.

 07:012:003 And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?

 07:012:004 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.

 07:012:005 And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;

 07:012:006 Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.

 07:012:007 And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.

 07:012:008 And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.

 07:012:009 And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.

 07:012:010 Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.

 07:012:011 And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.

 07:012:012 And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun.

 07:012:013 And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.

 07:012:014 And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.

 07:012:015 And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.

 07:013:001 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.

 07:013:002 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.

 07:013:003 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.

 07:013:004 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:

 07:013:005 For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.

 07:013:006 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:

 07:013:007 But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.

 07:013:008 Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.

 07:013:009 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.

 07:013:010 And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day.

 07:013:011 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.

 07:013:012 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?

 07:013:013 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.

 07:013:014 She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.

 07:013:015 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.

 07:013:016 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.

 07:013:017 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?

 07:013:018 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?

 07:013:019 So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.

 07:013:020 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.

 07:013:021 But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.

 07:013:022 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.

 07:013:023 But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.

 07:013:024 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.

 07:013:025 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.

 07:014:001 And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.

 07:014:002 And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.

 07:014:003 Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.

 07:014:004 But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.

 07:014:005 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.

 07:014:006 And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.

 07:014:007 And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.

 07:014:008 And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.

 07:014:009 And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.

 07:014:010 So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.

 07:014:011 And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.

 07:014:012 And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:

 07:014:013 But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.

 07:014:014 And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.

 07:014:015 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?

 07:014:016 And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?

 07:014:017 And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.

 07:014:018 And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? and he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.

 07:014:019 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.

 07:014:020 But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.

 07:015:001 But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.

 07:015:002 And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.

 07:015:003 And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.

 07:015:004 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.

 07:015:005 And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.

 07:015:006 Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.

 07:015:007 And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.

 07:015:008 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.

 07:015:009 Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.

 07:015:010 And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.

 07:015:011 Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.

 07:015:012 And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.

 07:015:013 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.

 07:015:014 And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.

 07:015:015 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.

 07:015:016 And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.

 07:015:017 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.

 07:015:018 And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?

 07:015:019 But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.

 07:015:020 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.

 07:016:001 Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.

 07:016:002 And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.

 07:016:003 And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.

 07:016:004 And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.

 07:016:005 And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.

 07:016:006 And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.

 07:016:007 And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.

 07:016:008 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.

 07:016:009 Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.

 07:016:010 And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.

 07:016:011 And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.

 07:016:012 Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.

 07:016:013 And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.

 07:016:014 And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.

 07:016:015 And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.

 07:016:016 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;

 07:016:017 That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.

 07:016:018 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.

 07:016:019 And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.

 07:016:020 And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.

 07:016:021 But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.

 07:016:022 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.

 07:016:023 Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.

 07:016:024 And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.

 07:016:025 And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.

 07:016:026 And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.

 07:016:027 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.

 07:016:028 And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.

 07:016:029 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.

 07:016:030 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.

 07:016:031 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.

 07:017:001 And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.

 07:017:002 And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.

 07:017:003 And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.

 07:017:004 Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.

 07:017:005 And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.

 07:017:006 In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.

 07:017:007 And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.

 07:017:008 And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.

 07:017:009 And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.

 07:017:010 And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.

 07:017:011 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.

 07:017:012 And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.

 07:017:013 Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.

 07:018:001 In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.

 07:018:002 And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.

 07:018:003 When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?

 07:018:004 And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.

 07:018:005 And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.

 07:018:006 And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein ye go.

 07:018:007 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.

 07:018:008 And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?

 07:018:009 And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.

 07:018:010 When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.

 07:018:011 And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.

 07:018:012 And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim.

 07:018:013 And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.

 07:018:014 Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.

 07:018:015 And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.

 07:018:016 And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.

 07:018:017 And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.

 07:018:018 And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?

 07:018:019 And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?

 07:018:020 And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.

 07:018:021 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.

 07:018:022 And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.

 07:018:023 And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?

 07:018:024 And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?

 07:018:025 And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.

 07:018:026 And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.

 07:018:027 And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.

 07:018:028 And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.

 07:018:029 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.

 07:018:030 And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.

 07:018:031 And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

 07:019:001 And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.

 07:019:002 And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months.

 07:019:003 And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.

 07:019:004 And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.

 07:019:005 And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.

 07:019:006 And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.

 07:019:007 And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.

 07:019:008 And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.

 07:019:009 And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.

 07:019:010 But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.

 07:019:011 And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.

 07:019:012 And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.

 07:019:013 And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.

 07:019:014 And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.

 07:019:015 And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging.

 07:019:016 And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.

 07:019:017 And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?

 07:019:018 And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me to house.

 07:019:019 Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.

 07:019:020 And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.

 07:019:021 So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.

 07:019:022 Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him.

 07:019:023 And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.

 07:019:024 Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.

 07:019:025 But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.

 07:019:026 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.

 07:019:027 And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold.

 07:019:028 And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.

 07:019:029 And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.

 07:019:030 And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.

 07:020:001 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.

 07:020:002 And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.

 07:020:003 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?

 07:020:004 And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.

 07:020:005 And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.

 07:020:006 And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.

 07:020:007 Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.

 07:020:008 And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.

 07:020:009 But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it;

 07:020:010 And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.

 07:020:011 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.

 07:020:012 And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?

 07:020:013 Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.

 07:020:014 But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.

 07:020:015 And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.

 07:020:016 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.

 07:020:017 And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.

 07:020:018 And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.

 07:020:019 And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.

 07:020:020 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.

 07:020:021 And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.

 07:020:022 And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.

 07:020:023 (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)

 07:020:024 And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.

 07:020:025 And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.

 07:020:026 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.

 07:020:027 And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,

 07:020:028 And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.

 07:020:029 And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.

 07:020:030 And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.

 07:020:031 And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.

 07:020:032 And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.

 07:020:033 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.

 07:020:034 And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them.

 07:020:035 And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.

 07:020:036 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.

 07:020:037 And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.

 07:020:038 Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.

 07:020:039 And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.

 07:020:040 But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.

 07:020:041 And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.

 07:020:042 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.

 07:020:043 Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.

 07:020:044 And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour.

 07:020:045 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.

 07:020:046 So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.

 07:020:047 But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.

 07:020:048 And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.

 07:021:001 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.

 07:021:002 And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;

 07:021:003 And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?

 07:021:004 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.

 07:021:005 And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.

 07:021:006 And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.

 07:021:007 How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?

 07:021:008 And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.

 07:021:009 For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.

 07:021:010 And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.

 07:021:011 And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.

 07:021:012 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.

 07:021:013 And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.

 07:021:014 And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.

 07:021:015 And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.

 07:021:016 Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?

 07:021:017 And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.

 07:021:018 Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.

 07:021:019 Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.

 07:021:020 Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;

 07:021:021 And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.

 07:021:022 And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.

 07:021:023 And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.

 07:021:024 And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.

 07:021:025 In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.

 Book 08 Ruth

 08:001:001 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.

 08:001:002 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.

 08:001:003 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.

 08:001:004 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.

 08:001:005 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.

 08:001:006 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.

 08:001:007 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.

 08:001:008 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.

 08:001:009 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.

 08:001:010 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.

 08:001:011 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?

 08:001:012 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;

 08:001:013 Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.

 08:001:014 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.

 08:001:015 And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.

 08:001:016 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:

 08:001:017 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.

 08:001:018 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.

 08:001:019 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?

 08:001:020 And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.

 08:001:021 I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?

 08:001:022 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.

 08:002:001 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.

 08:002:002 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.

 08:002:003 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.

 08:002:004 And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.

 08:002:005 Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?

 08:002:006 And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:

 08:002:007 And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.

 08:002:008 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:

 08:002:009 Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.

 08:002:010 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?

 08:002:011 And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.

 08:002:012 The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.

 08:002:013 Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.

 08:002:014 And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.

 08:002:015 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:

 08:002:016 And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.

 08:002:017 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.

 08:002:018 And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.

 08:002:019 And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.

 08:002:020 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.

 08:002:021 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.

 08:002:022 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.

 08:002:023 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.

 08:003:001 Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?

 08:003:002 And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.

 08:003:003 Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.

 08:003:004 And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.

 08:003:005 And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.

 08:003:006 And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.

 08:003:007 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.

 08:003:008 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.

 08:003:009 And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.

 08:003:010 And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.

 08:003:011 And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.

 08:003:012 And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.

 08:003:013 Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.

 08:003:014 And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.

 08:003:015 Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.

 08:003:016 And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.

 08:003:017 And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.

 08:003:018 Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.

 08:004:001 Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.

 08:004:002 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.

 08:004:003 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:

 08:004:004 And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.

 08:004:005 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.

 08:004:006 And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.

 08:004:007 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel.

 08:004:008 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his shoe.

 08:004:009 And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.

 08:004:010 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.

 08:004:011 And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:

 08:004:012 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.

 08:004:013 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.

 08:004:014 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.

 08:004:015 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.

 08:004:016 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.

 08:004:017 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.

 08:004:018 Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,

 08:004:019 And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,

 08:004:020 And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,

 08:004:021 And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,

 08:004:022 And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.

 Book 09 1 Samuel

 09:001:001 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:

 09:001:002 And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.

 09:001:003 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.

 09:001:004 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:

 09:001:005 But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.

 09:001:006 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.

 09:001:007 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.

 09:001:008 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?

 09:001:009 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.

 09:001:010 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.

 09:001:011 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.

 09:001:012 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.

 09:001:013 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.

 09:001:014 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.

 09:001:015 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.

 09:001:016 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.

 09:001:017 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.

 09:001:018 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.

 09:001:019 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.

 09:001:020 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.

 09:001:021 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.

 09:001:022 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.

 09:001:023 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.

 09:001:024 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.

 09:001:025 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.

 09:001:026 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.

 09:001:027 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:

 09:001:028 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.

 09:002:001 And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.

 09:002:002 There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.

 09:002:003 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.

 09:002:004 The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.

 09:002:005 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.

 09:002:006 The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.

 09:002:007 The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.

 09:002:008 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.

 09:002:009 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.

 09:002:010 The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.

 09:002:011 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.

 09:002:012 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.

 09:002:013 And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;

 09:002:014 And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.

 09:002:015 Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.

 09:002:016 And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.

 09:002:017 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.

 09:002:018 But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.

 09:002:019 Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.

 09:002:020 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.

 09:002:021 And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.

 09:002:022 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 09:002:023 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.

 09:002:024 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD's people to transgress.

 09:002:025 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.

 09:002:026 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.

 09:002:027 And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?

 09:002:028 And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?

 09:002:029 Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?

 09:002:030 Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.

 09:002:031 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.

 09:002:032 And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.

 09:002:033 And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.

 09:002:034 And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.

 09:002:035 And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.

 09:002:036 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.

 09:003:001 And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.

 09:003:002 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;

 09:003:003 And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;

 09:003:004 That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.

 09:003:005 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.

 09:003:006 And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.

 09:003:007 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.

 09:003:008 And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.

 09:003:009 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

 09:003:010 And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.

 09:003:011 And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.

 09:003:012 In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.

 09:003:013 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.

 09:003:014 And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.

 09:003:015 And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.

 09:003:016 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.

 09:003:017 And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.

 09:003:018 And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.

 09:003:019 And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.

 09:003:020 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.

 09:003:021 And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.

 09:004:001 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.

 09:004:002 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.

 09:004:003 And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.

 09:004:004 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.

 09:004:005 And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.

 09:004:006 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.

 09:004:007 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.

 09:004:008 Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.

 09:004:009 Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.

 09:004:010 And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.

 09:004:011 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.

 09:004:012 And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.

 09:004:013 And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.

 09:004:014 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.

 09:004:015 Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.

 09:004:016 And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?

 09:004:017 And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.

 09:004:018 And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.

 09:004:019 And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.

 09:004:020 And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.

 09:004:021 And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.

 09:004:022 And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.

 09:005:001 And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod.

 09:005:002 When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.

 09:005:003 And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.

 09:005:004 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.

 09:005:005 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.

 09:005:006 But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.

 09:005:007 And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.

 09:005:008 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.

 09:005:009 And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.

 09:005:010 Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.

 09:005:011 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.

 09:005:012 And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.

 09:006:001 And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.

 09:006:002 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.

 09:006:003 And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.

 09:006:004 Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.

 09:006:005 Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.

 09:006:006 Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?

 09:006:007 Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:

 09:006:008 And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.

 09:006:009 And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us.

 09:006:010 And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:

 09:006:011 And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.

 09:006:012 And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh.

 09:006:013 And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.

 09:006:014 And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD.

 09:006:015 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.

 09:006:016 And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.

 09:006:017 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;

 09:006:018 And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite.

 09:006:019 And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.

 09:006:020 And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?

 09:006:021 And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.

 09:007:001 And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.

 09:007:002 And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.

 09:007:003 And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.

 09:007:004 Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.

 09:007:005 And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD.

 09:007:006 And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.

 09:007:007 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.

 09:007:008 And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.

 09:007:009 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him.

 09:007:010 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.

 09:007:011 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.

 09:007:012 Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.

 09:007:013 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.

 09:007:014 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.

 09:007:015 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.

 09:007:016 And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.

 09:007:017 And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.

 09:008:001 And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.

 09:008:002 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.

 09:008:003 And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.

 09:008:004 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,

 09:008:005 And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.

 09:008:006 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.

 09:008:007 And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.

 09:008:008 According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.

 09:008:009 Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.

 09:008:010 And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.

 09:008:011 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.

 09:008:012 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.

 09:008:013 And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.

 09:008:014 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.

 09:008:015 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.

 09:008:016 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.

 09:008:017 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.

 09:008:018 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.

 09:008:019 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;

 09:008:020 That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.

 09:008:021 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.

 09:008:022 And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.

 09:009:001 Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.

 09:009:002 And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.

 09:009:003 And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.

 09:009:004 And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.

 09:009:005 And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.

 09:009:006 And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.

 09:009:007 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?

 09:009:008 And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.

 09:009:009 (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)

 09:009:010 Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.

 09:009:011 And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?

 09:009:012 And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:

 09:009:013 As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.

 09:009:014 And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.

 09:009:015 Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,

 09:009:016 To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.

 09:009:017 And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.

 09:009:018 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.

 09:009:019 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.

 09:009:020 And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?

 09:009:021 And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?

 09:009:022 And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.

 09:009:023 And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.

 09:009:024 And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.

 09:009:025 And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.

 09:009:026 And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.

 09:009:027 And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.

 09:010:001 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?

 09:010:002 When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?

 09:010:003 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:

 09:010:004 And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.

 09:010:005 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:

 09:010:006 And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.

 09:010:007 And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.

 09:010:008 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.

 09:010:009 And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.

 09:010:010 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.

 09:010:011 And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?

 09:010:012 And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?

 09:010:013 And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.

 09:010:014 And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.

 09:010:015 And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.

 09:010:016 And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.

 09:010:017 And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;

 09:010:018 And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:

 09:010:019 And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.

 09:010:020 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.

 09:010:021 When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.

 09:010:022 Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid himself among the stuff.

 09:010:023 And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.

 09:010:024 And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.

 09:010:025 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.

 09:010:026 And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.

 09:010:027 But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.

 09:011:001 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.

 09:011:002 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.

 09:011:003 And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.

 09:011:004 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.

 09:011:005 And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.

 09:011:006 And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.

 09:011:007 And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.

 09:011:008 And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.

 09:011:009 And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.

 09:011:010 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.

 09:011:011 And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.

 09:011:012 And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.

 09:011:013 And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.

 09:011:014 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.

 09:011:015 And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.

 09:012:001 And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.

 09:012:002 And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.

 09:012:003 Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.

 09:012:004 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.

 09:012:005 And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.

 09:012:006 And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.

 09:012:007 Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.

 09:012:008 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.

 09:012:009 And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.

 09:012:010 And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.

 09:012:011 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.

 09:012:012 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.

 09:012:013 Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.

 09:012:014 If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:

 09:012:015 But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.

 09:012:016 Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.

 09:012:017 Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.

 09:012:018 So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.

 09:012:019 And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.

 09:012:020 And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;

 09:012:021 And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.

 09:012:022 For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.

 09:012:023 Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:

 09:012:024 Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.

 09:012:025 But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.

 09:013:001 Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,

 09:013:002 Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.

 09:013:003 And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.

 09:013:004 And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.

 09:013:005 And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.

 09:013:006 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.

 09:013:007 And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.

 09:013:008 And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.

 09:013:009 And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.

 09:013:010 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.

 09:013:011 And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;

 09:013:012 Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.

 09:013:013 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.

 09:013:014 But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.

 09:013:015 And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.

 09:013:016 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.

 09:013:017 And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:

 09:013:018 And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.

 09:013:019 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:

 09:013:020 But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.

 09:013:021 Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.

 09:013:022 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.

 09:013:023 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.

 09:014:001 Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.

 09:014:002 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;

 09:014:003 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.

 09:014:004 And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.

 09:014:005 The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.

 09:014:006 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.

 09:014:007 And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.

 09:014:008 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.

 09:014:009 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.

 09:014:010 But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.

 09:014:011 And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.

 09:014:012 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.

 09:014:013 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.

 09:014:014 And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.

 09:014:015 And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.

 09:014:016 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.

 09:014:017 Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.

 09:014:018 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.

 09:014:019 And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.

 09:014:020 And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.

 09:014:021 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.

 09:014:022 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.

 09:014:023 So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.

 09:014:024 And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.

 09:014:025 And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.

 09:014:026 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.

 09:014:027 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.

 09:014:028 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.

 09:014:029 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.

 09:014:030 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?

 09:014:031 And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.

 09:014:032 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.

 09:014:033 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.

 09:014:034 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.

 09:014:035 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.

 09:014:036 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.

 09:014:037 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.

 09:014:038 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.

 09:014:039 For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.

 09:014:040 Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.

 09:014:041 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.

 09:014:042 And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.

 09:014:043 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.

 09:014:044 And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.

 09:014:045 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.

 09:014:046 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.

 09:014:047 So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.

 09:014:048 And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.

 09:014:049 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:

 09:014:050 And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.

 09:014:051 And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.

 09:014:052 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.

 09:015:001 Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.

 09:015:002 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.

 09:015:003 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

 09:015:004 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.

 09:015:005 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.

 09:015:006 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.

 09:015:007 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.

 09:015:008 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.

 09:015:009 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.

 09:015:010 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,

 09:015:011 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.

 09:015:012 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.

 09:015:013 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.

 09:015:014 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?

 09:015:015 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.

 09:015:016 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.

 09:015:017 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?

 09:015:018 And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.

 09:015:019 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?

 09:015:020 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.

 09:015:021 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.

 09:015:022 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.

 09:015:023 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.

 09:015:024 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.

 09:015:025 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.

 09:015:026 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.

 09:015:027 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.

 09:015:028 And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.

 09:015:029 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.

 09:015:030 Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.

 09:015:031 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.

 09:015:032 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.

 09:015:033 And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.

 09:015:034 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.

 09:015:035 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.

 09:016:001 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.

 09:016:002 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.

 09:016:003 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.

 09:016:004 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?

 09:016:005 And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.

 09:016:006 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.

 09:016:007 But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.

 09:016:008 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.

 09:016:009 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.

 09:016:010 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.

 09:016:011 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.

 09:016:012 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.

 09:016:013 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.

 09:016:014 But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.

 09:016:015 And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.

 09:016:016 Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.

 09:016:017 And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.

 09:016:018 Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.

 09:016:019 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep.

 09:016:020 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.

 09:016:021 And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.

 09:016:022 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.

 09:016:023 And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.

 09:017:001 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.

 09:017:002 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.

 09:017:003 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.

 09:017:004 And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.

 09:017:005 And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.

 09:017:006 And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.

 09:017:007 And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.

 09:017:008 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.

 09:017:009 If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.

 09:017:010 And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.

 09:017:011 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.

 09:017:012 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.

 09:017:013 And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.

 09:017:014 And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.

 09:017:015 But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.

 09:017:016 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.

 09:017:017 And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp of thy brethren;

 09:017:018 And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.

 09:017:019 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.

 09:017:020 And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.

 09:017:021 For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.

 09:017:022 And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.

 09:017:023 And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.

 09:017:024 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.

 09:017:025 And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.

 09:017:026 And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?

 09:017:027 And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.

 09:017:028 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.

 09:017:029 And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?

 09:017:030 And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.

 09:017:031 And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.

 09:017:032 And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.

 09:017:033 And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.

 09:017:034 And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:

 09:017:035 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.

 09:017:036 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.

 09:017:037 David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.

 09:017:038 And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.

 09:017:039 And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.

 09:017:040 And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.

 09:017:041 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.

 09:017:042 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.

 09:017:043 And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.

 09:017:044 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.

 09:017:045 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.

 09:017:046 This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.

 09:017:047 And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.

 09:017:048 And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.

 09:017:049 And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.

 09:017:050 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.

 09:017:051 Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.

 09:017:052 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.

 09:017:053 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.

 09:017:054 And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.

 09:017:055 And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.

 09:017:056 And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.

 09:017:057 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.

 09:017:058 And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.

 09:018:001 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.

 09:018:002 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.

 09:018:003 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.

 09:018:004 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.

 09:018:005 And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.

 09:018:006 And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.

 09:018:007 And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.

 09:018:008 And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?

 09:018:009 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.

 09:018:010 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.

 09:018:011 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.

 09:018:012 And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.

 09:018:013 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.

 09:018:014 And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.

 09:018:015 Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.

 09:018:016 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.

 09:018:017 And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.

 09:018:018 And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?

 09:018:019 But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.

 09:018:020 And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.

 09:018:021 And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain.

 09:018:022 And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law.

 09:018:023 And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?

 09:018:024 And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.

 09:018:025 And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.

 09:018:026 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.

 09:018:027 Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.

 09:018:028 And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him.

 09:018:029 And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.

 09:018:030 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.

 09:019:001 And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.

 09:019:002 But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:

 09:019:003 And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.

 09:019:004 And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:

 09:019:005 For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?

 09:019:006 And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.

 09:019:007 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.

 09:019:008 And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.

 09:019:009 And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.

 09:019:010 And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.

 09:019:011 Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.

 09:019:012 So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.

 09:019:013 And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.

 09:019:014 And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.

 09:019:015 And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.

 09:019:016 And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.

 09:019:017 And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?

 09:019:018 So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.

 09:019:019 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.

 09:019:020 And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.

 09:019:021 And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.

 09:019:022 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.

 09:019:023 And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.

 09:019:024 And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?

 09:020:001 And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?

 09:020:002 And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.

 09:020:003 And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.

 09:020:004 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.

 09:020:005 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.

 09:020:006 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.

 09:020:007 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.

 09:020:008 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?

 09:020:009 And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?

 09:020:010 Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?

 09:020:011 And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.

 09:020:012 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;

 09:020:013 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.

 09:020:014 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:

 09:020:015 But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.

 09:020:016 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.

 09:020:017 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.

 09:020:018 Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.

 09:020:019 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.

 09:020:020 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.

 09:020:021 And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.

 09:020:022 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.

 09:020:023 And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.

 09:020:024 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.

 09:020:025 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.

 09:020:026 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.

 09:020:027 And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?

 09:020:028 And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:

 09:020:029 And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.

 09:020:030 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?

 09:020:031 For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.

 09:020:032 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?

 09:020:033 And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.

 09:020:034 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.

 09:020:035 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.

 09:020:036 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.

 09:020:037 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?

 09:020:038 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.

 09:020:039 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.

 09:020:040 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.

 09:020:041 And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.

 09:020:042 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.

 09:021:001 Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?

 09:021:002 And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.

 09:021:003 Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present.

 09:021:004 And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.

 09:021:005 And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.

 09:021:006 So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.

 09:021:007 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.

 09:021:008 And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.

 09:021:009 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.

 09:021:010 And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.

 09:021:011 And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?

 09:021:012 And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.

 09:021:013 And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.

 09:021:014 Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?

 09:021:015 Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?

 09:022:001 David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.

 09:022:002 And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.

 09:022:003 And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.

 09:022:004 And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.

 09:022:005 And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.

 09:022:006 When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)

 09:022:007 Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;

 09:022:008 That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

 09:022:009 Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.

 09:022:010 And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.

 09:022:011 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.

 09:022:012 And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.

 09:022:013 And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

 09:022:014 Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?

 09:022:015 Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.

 09:022:016 And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.

 09:022:017 And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.

 09:022:018 And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.

 09:022:019 And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.

 09:022:020 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.

 09:022:021 And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests.

 09:022:022 And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.

 09:022:023 Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.

 09:023:001 Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.

 09:023:002 Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.

 09:023:003 And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?

 09:023:004 Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.

 09:023:005 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.

 09:023:006 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.

 09:023:007 And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.

 09:023:008 And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.

 09:023:009 And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.

 09:023:010 Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.

 09:023:011 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.

 09:023:012 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.

 09:023:013 Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.

 09:023:014 And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.

 09:023:015 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.

 09:023:016 And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.

 09:023:017 And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.

 09:023:018 And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.

 09:023:019 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?

 09:023:020 Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.

 09:023:021 And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.

 09:023:022 Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly.

 09:023:023 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.

 09:023:024 And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.

 09:023:025 Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David; wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.

 09:023:026 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.

 09:023:027 But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.

 09:023:028 Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.

 09:023:029 And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi.

 09:024:001 And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.

 09:024:002 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.

 09:024:003 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.

 09:024:004 And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.

 09:024:005 And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.

 09:024:006 And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.

 09:024:007 So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.

 09:024:008 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.

 09:024:009 And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?

 09:024:010 Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD's anointed.

 09:024:011 Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.

 09:024:012 The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

 09:024:013 As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

 09:024:014 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.

 09:024:015 The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.

 09:024:016 And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.

 09:024:017 And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.

 09:024:018 And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.

 09:024:019 For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.

 09:024:020 And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.

 09:024:021 Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.

 09:024:022 And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.

 09:025:001 And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.

 09:025:002 And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

 09:025:003 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.

 09:025:004 And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.

 09:025:005 And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:

 09:025:006 And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.

 09:025:007 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.

 09:025:008 Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.

 09:025:009 And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.

 09:025:010 And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.

 09:025:011 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?

 09:025:012 So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.

 09:025:013 And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.

 09:025:014 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.

 09:025:015 But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:

 09:025:016 They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.

 09:025:017 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.

 09:025:018 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.

 09:025:019 And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.

 09:025:020 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.

 09:025:021 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.

 09:025:022 So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.

 09:025:023 And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,

 09:025:024 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.

 09:025:025 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.

 09:025:026 Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.

 09:025:027 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.

 09:025:028 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.

 09:025:029 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.

 09:025:030 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;

 09:025:031 That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.

 09:025:032 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:

 09:025:033 And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.

 09:025:034 For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.

 09:025:035 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.

 09:025:036 And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.

 09:025:037 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.

 09:025:038 And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.

 09:025:039 And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.

 09:025:040 And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.

 09:025:041 And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.

 09:025:042 And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.

 09:025:043 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.

 09:025:044 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.

 09:026:001 And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?

 09:026:002 Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.

 09:026:003 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.

 09:026:004 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.

 09:026:005 And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.

 09:026:006 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.

 09:026:007 So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.

 09:026:008 Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.

 09:026:009 And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?

 09:026:010 David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.

 09:026:011 The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.

 09:026:012 So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.

 09:026:013 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:

 09:026:014 And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?

 09:026:015 And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.

 09:026:016 This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.

 09:026:017 And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.

 09:026:018 And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?

 09:026:019 Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.

 09:026:020 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.

 09:026:021 Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.

 09:026:022 And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.

 09:026:023 The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed.

 09:026:024 And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.

 09:026:025 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

 09:027:001 And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.

 09:027:002 And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.

 09:027:003 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.

 09:027:004 And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.

 09:027:005 And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?

 09:027:006 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.

 09:027:007 And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.

 09:027:008 And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.

 09:027:009 And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.

 09:027:010 And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.

 09:027:011 And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines.

 09:027:012 And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.

 09:028:001 And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.

 09:028:002 And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.

 09:028:003 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.

 09:028:004 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.

 09:028:005 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.

 09:028:006 And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.

 09:028:007 Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.

 09:028:008 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.

 09:028:009 And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?

 09:028:010 And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.

 09:028:011 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.

 09:028:012 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.

 09:028:013 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.

 09:028:014 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.

 09:028:015 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.

 09:028:016 Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?

 09:028:017 And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David:

 09:028:018 Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.

 09:028:019 Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.

 09:028:020 Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.

 09:028:021 And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.

 09:028:022 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.

 09:028:023 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.

 09:028:024 And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:

 09:028:025 And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.

 09:029:001 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.

 09:029:002 And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.

 09:029:003 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?

 09:029:004 And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?

 09:029:005 Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?

 09:029:006 Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.

 09:029:007 Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.

 09:029:008 And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?

 09:029:009 And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.

 09:029:010 Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.

 09:029:011 So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.

 09:030:001 And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;

 09:030:002 And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.

 09:030:003 So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.

 09:030:004 Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.

 09:030:005 And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

 09:030:006 And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.

 09:030:007 And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.

 09:030:008 And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.

 09:030:009 So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.

 09:030:010 But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.

 09:030:011 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;

 09:030:012 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.

 09:030:013 And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.

 09:030:014 We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.

 09:030:015 And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.

 09:030:016 And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.

 09:030:017 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.

 09:030:018 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.

 09:030:019 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.

 09:030:020 And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.

 09:030:021 And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.

 09:030:022 Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.

 09:030:023 Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.

 09:030:024 For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.

 09:030:025 And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.

 09:030:026 And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;

 09:030:027 To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,

 09:030:028 And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,

 09:030:029 And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites,

 09:030:030 And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,

 09:030:031 And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.

 09:031:001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.

 09:031:002 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons.

 09:031:003 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.

 09:031:004 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

 09:031:005 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.

 09:031:006 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.

 09:031:007 And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.

 09:031:008 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.

 09:031:009 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.

 09:031:010 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.

 09:031:011 And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;

 09:031:012 All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.

 09:031:013 And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

 Book 10 2 Samuel

 10:001:001 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;

 10:001:002 It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.

 10:001:003 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.

 10:001:004 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.

 10:001:005 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?

 10:001:006 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.

 10:001:007 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.

 10:001:008 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.

 10:001:009 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.

 10:001:010 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.

 10:001:011 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:

 10:001:012 And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.

 10:001:013 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.

 10:001:014 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?

 10:001:015 And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.

 10:001:016 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.

 10:001:017 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:

 10:001:018 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)

 10:001:019 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!

 10:001:020 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.

 10:001:021 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.

 10:001:022 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.

 10:001:023 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.

 10:001:024 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.

 10:001:025 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.

 10:001:026 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.

 10:001:027 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

 10:002:001 And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.

 10:002:002 So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.

 10:002:003 And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.

 10:002:004 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.

 10:002:005 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.

 10:002:006 And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.

 10:002:007 Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.

 10:002:008 But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;

 10:002:009 And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.

 10:002:010 Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.

 10:002:011 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.

 10:002:012 And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

 10:002:013 And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.

 10:002:014 And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.

 10:002:015 Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.

 10:002:016 And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.

 10:002:017 And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.

 10:002:018 And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.

 10:002:019 And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.

 10:002:020 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am.

 10:002:021 And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.

 10:002:022 And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?

 10:002:023 Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.

 10:002:024 Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.

 10:002:025 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.

 10:002:026 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?

 10:002:027 And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.

 10:002:028 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.

 10:002:029 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.

 10:002:030 And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.

 10:002:031 But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.

 10:002:032 And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.

 10:003:001 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.

 10:003:002 And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;

 10:003:003 And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;

 10:003:004 And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;

 10:003:005 And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.

 10:003:006 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.

 10:003:007 And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?

 10:003:008 Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?

 10:003:009 So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;

 10:003:010 To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.

 10:003:011 And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.

 10:003:012 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.

 10:003:013 And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.

 10:003:014 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.

 10:003:015 And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.

 10:003:016 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.

 10:003:017 And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:

 10:003:018 Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.

 10:003:019 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.

 10:003:020 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.

 10:003:021 And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.

 10:003:022 And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.

 10:003:023 When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.

 10:003:024 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?

 10:003:025 Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.

 10:003:026 And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.

 10:003:027 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.

 10:003:028 And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:

 10:003:029 Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.

 10:003:030 So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.

 10:003:031 And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.

 10:003:032 And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.

 10:003:033 And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?

 10:003:034 Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.

 10:003:035 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.

 10:003:036 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.

 10:003:037 For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.

 10:003:038 And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?

 10:003:039 And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.

 10:004:001 And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.

 10:004:002 And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.

 10:004:003 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)

 10:004:004 And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.

 10:004:005 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.

 10:004:006 And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.

 10:004:007 For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.

 10:004:008 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.

 10:004:009 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,

 10:004:010 When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:

 10:004:011 How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?

 10:004:012 And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.

 10:005:001 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

 10:005:002 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.

 10:005:003 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.

 10:005:004 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.

 10:005:005 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.

 10:005:006 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.

 10:005:007 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.

 10:005:008 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.

 10:005:009 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.

 10:005:010 And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.

 10:005:011 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.

 10:005:012 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.

 10:005:013 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.

 10:005:014 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,

 10:005:015 Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

 10:005:016 And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.

 10:005:017 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.

 10:005:018 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.

 10:005:019 And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.

 10:005:020 And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.

 10:005:021 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.

 10:005:022 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.

 10:005:023 And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.

 10:005:024 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.

 10:005:025 And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.

 10:006:001 Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.

 10:006:002 And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.

 10:006:003 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.

 10:006:004 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.

 10:006:005 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.

 10:006:006 And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.

 10:006:007 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.

 10:006:008 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.

 10:006:009 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?

 10:006:010 So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.

 10:006:011 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.

 10:006:012 And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.

 10:006:013 And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.

 10:006:014 And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.

 10:006:015 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.

 10:006:016 And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.

 10:006:017 And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.

 10:006:018 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.

 10:006:019 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.

 10:006:020 Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!

 10:006:021 And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.

 10:006:022 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.

 10:006:023 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.

 10:007:001 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;

 10:007:002 That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.

 10:007:003 And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee.

 10:007:004 And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,

 10:007:005 Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?

 10:007:006 Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.

 10:007:007 In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?

 10:007:008 Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:

 10:007:009 And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.

 10:007:010 Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,

 10:007:011 And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.

 10:007:012 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.

 10:007:013 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.

 10:007:014 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:

 10:007:015 But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.

 10:007:016 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.

 10:007:017 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

 10:007:018 Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?

 10:007:019 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?

 10:007:020 And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.

 10:007:021 For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.

 10:007:022 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.

 10:007:023 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?

 10:007:024 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.

 10:007:025 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.

 10:007:026 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.

 10:007:027 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.

 10:007:028 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:

 10:007:029 Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.

 10:008:001 And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines.

 10:008:002 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.

 10:008:003 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.

 10:008:004 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.

 10:008:005 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.

 10:008:006 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

 10:008:007 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

 10:008:008 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.

 10:008:009 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,

 10:008:010 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:

 10:008:011 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;

 10:008:012 Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.

 10:008:013 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.

 10:008:014 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

 10:008:015 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.

 10:008:016 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;

 10:008:017 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;

 10:008:018 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.

 10:009:001 And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?

 10:009:002 And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.

 10:009:003 And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.

 10:009:004 And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.

 10:009:005 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.

 10:009:006 Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!

 10:009:007 And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.

 10:009:008 And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?

 10:009:009 Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.

 10:009:010 Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.

 10:009:011 Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.

 10:009:012 And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.

 10:009:013 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.

 10:010:001 And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.

 10:010:002 Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.

 10:010:003 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?

 10:010:004 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.

 10:010:005 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.

 10:010:006 And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.

 10:010:007 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.

 10:010:008 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.

 10:010:009 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:

 10:010:010 And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.

 10:010:011 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.

 10:010:012 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.

 10:010:013 And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.

 10:010:014 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.

 10:010:015 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together.

 10:010:016 And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.

 10:010:017 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.

 10:010:018 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.

 10:010:019 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.

 10:011:001 And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.

 10:011:002 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.

 10:011:003 And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?

 10:011:004 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.

 10:011:005 And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child.

 10:011:006 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.

 10:011:007 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.

 10:011:008 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king.

 10:011:009 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.

 10:011:010 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?

 10:011:011 And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.

 10:011:012 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.

 10:011:013 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.

 10:011:014 And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.

 10:011:015 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.

 10:011:016 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.

 10:011:017 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.

 10:011:018 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;

 10:011:019 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,

 10:011:020 And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?

 10:011:021 Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

 10:011:022 So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for.

 10:011:023 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.

 10:011:024 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

 10:011:025 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.

 10:011:026 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.

 10:011:027 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.

 10:012:001 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.

 10:012:002 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:

 10:012:003 But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.

 10:012:004 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.

 10:012:005 And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die:

 10:012:006 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.

 10:012:007 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;

 10:012:008 And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.

 10:012:009 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.

 10:012:010 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.

 10:012:011 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.

 10:012:012 For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.

 10:012:013 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.

 10:012:014 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.

 10:012:015 And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.

 10:012:016 David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.

 10:012:017 And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.

 10:012:018 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?

 10:012:019 But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.

 10:012:020 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.

 10:012:021 Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.

 10:012:022 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?

 10:012:023 But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.

 10:012:024 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.

 10:012:025 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.

 10:012:026 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.

 10:012:027 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.

 10:012:028 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.

 10:012:029 And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.

 10:012:030 And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.

 10:012:031 And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.

 10:013:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.

 10:013:002 And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her.

 10:013:003 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.

 10:013:004 And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.

 10:013:005 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.

 10:013:006 So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.

 10:013:007 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat.

 10:013:008 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.

 10:013:009 And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.

 10:013:010 And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.

 10:013:011 And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.

 10:013:012 And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.

 10:013:013 And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.

 10:013:014 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.

 10:013:015 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.

 10:013:016 And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.

 10:013:017 Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.

 10:013:018 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.

 10:013:019 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.

 10:013:020 And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.

 10:013:021 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.

 10:013:022 And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.

 10:013:023 And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.

 10:013:024 And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.

 10:013:025 And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.

 10:013:026 Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?

 10:013:027 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.

 10:013:028 Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.

 10:013:029 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.

 10:013:030 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.

 10:013:031 Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.

 10:013:032 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.

 10:013:033 Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.

 10:013:034 But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.

 10:013:035 And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.

 10:013:036 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.

 10:013:037 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.

 10:013:038 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.

 10:013:039 And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

 10:014:001 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.

 10:014:002 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:

 10:014:003 And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.

 10:014:004 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.

 10:014:005 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.

 10:014:006 And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.

 10:014:007 And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.

 10:014:008 And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.

 10:014:009 And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.

 10:014:010 And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.

 10:014:011 Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.

 10:014:012 Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.

 10:014:013 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.

 10:014:014 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.

 10:014:015 Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.

 10:014:016 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.

 10:014:017 Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.

 10:014:018 Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.

 10:014:019 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:

 10:014:020 To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.

 10:014:021 And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.

 10:014:022 And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.

 10:014:023 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.

 10:014:024 And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.

 10:014:025 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.

 10:014:026 And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.

 10:014:027 And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.

 10:014:028 So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.

 10:014:029 Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.

 10:014:030 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.

 10:014:031 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?

 10:014:032 And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.

 10:014:033 So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.

 10:015:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.

 10:015:002 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.

 10:015:003 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.

 10:015:004 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!

 10:015:005 And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.

 10:015:006 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.

 10:015:007 And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.

 10:015:008 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.

 10:015:009 And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.

 10:015:010 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.

 10:015:011 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.

 10:015:012 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.

 10:015:013 And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.

 10:015:014 And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.

 10:015:015 And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.

 10:015:016 And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.

 10:015:017 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.

 10:015:018 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.

 10:015:019 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.

 10:015:020 Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.

 10:015:021 And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.

 10:015:022 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.

 10:015:023 And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.

 10:015:024 And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.

 10:015:025 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:

 10:015:026 But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.

 10:015:027 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.

 10:015:028 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.

 10:015:029 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.

 10:015:030 And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.

 10:015:031 And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.

 10:015:032 And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:

 10:015:033 Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:

 10:015:034 But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.

 10:015:035 And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.

 10:015:036 Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.

 10:015:037 So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.

 10:016:001 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.

 10:016:002 And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.

 10:016:003 And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.

 10:016:004 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.

 10:016:005 And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.

 10:016:006 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.

 10:016:007 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:

 10:016:008 The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.

 10:016:009 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.

 10:016:010 And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?

 10:016:011 And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.

 10:016:012 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.

 10:016:013 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.

 10:016:014 And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.

 10:016:015 And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.

 10:016:016 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.

 10:016:017 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?

 10:016:018 And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.

 10:016:019 And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.

 10:016:020 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.

 10:016:021 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.

 10:016:022 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.

 10:016:023 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.

 10:017:001 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:

 10:017:002 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:

 10:017:003 And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.

 10:017:004 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.

 10:017:005 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.

 10:017:006 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou.

 10:017:007 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.

 10:017:008 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.

 10:017:009 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.

 10:017:010 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.

 10:017:011 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.

 10:017:012 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.

 10:017:013 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.

 10:017:014 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.

 10:017:015 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.

 10:017:016 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.

 10:017:017 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.

 10:017:018 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.

 10:017:019 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.

 10:017:020 And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.

 10:017:021 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.

 10:017:022 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.

 10:017:023 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.

 10:017:024 Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.

 10:017:025 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.

 10:017:026 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.

 10:017:027 And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,

 10:017:028 Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse,

 10:017:029 And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.

 10:018:001 And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.

 10:018:002 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.

 10:018:003 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.

 10:018:004 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.

 10:018:005 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.

 10:018:006 So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;

 10:018:007 Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.

 10:018:008 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.

 10:018:009 And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.

 10:018:010 And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.

 10:018:011 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.

 10:018:012 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.

 10:018:013 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.

 10:018:014 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.

 10:018:015 And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.

 10:018:016 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.

 10:018:017 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.

 10:018:018 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.

 10:018:019 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.

 10:018:020 And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.

 10:018:021 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.

 10:018:022 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?

 10:018:023 But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.

 10:018:024 And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.

 10:018:025 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.

 10:018:026 And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.

 10:018:027 And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.

 10:018:028 And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.

 10:018:029 And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.

 10:018:030 And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.

 10:018:031 And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.

 10:018:032 And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.

 10:018:033 And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!

 10:019:001 And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.

 10:019:002 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.

 10:019:003 And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.

 10:019:004 But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!

 10:019:005 And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;

 10:019:006 In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.

 10:019:007 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.

 10:019:008 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.

 10:019:009 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.

 10:019:010 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?

 10:019:011 And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.

 10:019:012 Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?

 10:019:013 And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.

 10:019:014 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.

 10:019:015 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.

 10:019:016 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.

 10:019:017 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.

 10:019:018 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;

 10:019:019 And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.

 10:019:020 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.

 10:019:021 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed?

 10:019:022 And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?

 10:019:023 Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.

 10:019:024 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.

 10:019:025 And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?

 10:019:026 And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.

 10:019:027 And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.

 10:019:028 For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?

 10:019:029 And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.

 10:019:030 And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.

 10:019:031 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.

 10:019:032 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.

 10:019:033 And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.

 10:019:034 And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?

 10:019:035 I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?

 10:019:036 Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?

 10:019:037 Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.

 10:019:038 And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.

 10:019:039 And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.

 10:019:040 Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.

 10:019:041 And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?

 10:019:042 And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift?

 10:019:043 And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.

 10:020:001 And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.

 10:020:002 So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.

 10:020:003 And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.

 10:020:004 Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.

 10:020:005 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.

 10:020:006 And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.

 10:020:007 And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

 10:020:008 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.

 10:020:009 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.

 10:020:010 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.

 10:020:011 And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.

 10:020:012 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.

 10:020:013 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

 10:020:014 And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.

 10:020:015 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.

 10:020:016 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.

 10:020:017 And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.

 10:020:018 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.

 10:020:019 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?

 10:020:020 And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.

 10:020:021 The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.

 10:020:022 Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.

 10:020:023 Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:

 10:020:024 And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:

 10:020:025 And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:

 10:020:026 And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.

 10:021:001 Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.

 10:021:002 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)

 10:021:003 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?

 10:021:004 And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.

 10:021:005 And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,

 10:021:006 Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.

 10:021:007 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.

 10:021:008 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son

 inging of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;

 22:002:013 The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.

 22:002:014 O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.

 22:002:015 Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.

 22:002:016 My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.

 22:002:017 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.

 22:003:001 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.

 22:003:002 I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.

 22:003:003 The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?

 22:003:004 It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.

 22:003:005 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.

 22:003:006 Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?

 22:003:007 Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel.

 22:003:008 They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.

 22:003:009 King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.

 22:003:010 He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.

 22:003:011 Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.

 22:004:001 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.

 22:004:002 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.

 22:004:003 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.

 22:004:004 Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.

 22:004:005 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.

 22:004:006 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.

 22:004:007 Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.

 22:004:008 Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

 22:004:009 Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.

 22:004:010 How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!

 22:004:011 Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.

 22:004:012 A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.

 22:004:013 Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,

 22:004:014 Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:

 22:004:015 A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.

 22:004:016 Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.

 22:005:001 I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.

 22:005:002 I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.

 22:005:003 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?

 22:005:004 My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.

 22:005:005 I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.

 22:005:006 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.

 22:005:007 The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.

 22:005:008 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.

 22:005:009 What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?

 22:005:010 My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.

 22:005:011 His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven.

 22:005:012 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.

 22:005:013 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.

 22:005:014 His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.

 22:005:015 His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.

 22:005:016 His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.

 22:006:001 Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.

 22:006:002 My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

 22:006:003 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.

 22:006:004 Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.

 22:006:005 Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.

 22:006:006 Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.

 22:006:007 As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.

 22:006:008 There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.

 22:006:009 My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.

 22:006:010 Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?

 22:006:011 I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded.

 22:006:012 Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.

 22:006:013 Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.

 22:007:001 How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.

 22:007:002 Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.

 22:007:003 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.

 22:007:004 Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.

 22:007:005 Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.

 22:007:006 How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!

 22:007:007 This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.

 22:007:008 I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;

 22:007:009 And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.

 22:007:010 I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.

 22:007:011 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.

 22:007:012 Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.

 22:007:013 The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.

 22:008:001 O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.

 22:008:002 I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.

 22:008:003 His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.

 22:008:004 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.

 22:008:005 Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.

 22:008:006 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.

 22:008:007 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.

 22:008:008 We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?

 22:008:009 If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.

 22:008:010 I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.

 22:008:011 Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.

 22:008:012 My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.

 22:008:013 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it.

 22:008:014 Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.

 Book 23 Isaiah

 23:001:001 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

 23:001:002 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.

 23:001:003 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.

 23:001:004 Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.

 23:001:005 Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.

 23:001:006 From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.

 23:001:007 Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.

 23:001:008 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.

 23:001:009 Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.

 23:001:010 Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.

 23:001:011 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.

 23:001:012 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?

 23:001:013 Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.

 23:001:014 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.

 23:001:015 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.

 23:001:016 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;

 23:001:017 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.

 23:001:018 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

 23:001:019 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:

 23:001:020 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.

 23:001:021 How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.

 23:001:022 Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:

 23:001:023 Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.

 23:001:024 Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:

 23:001:025 And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:

 23:001:026 And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.

 23:001:027 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.

 23:001:028 And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.

 23:001:029 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.

 23:001:030 For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.

 23:001:031 And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.

 23:002:001 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.

 23:002:002 And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.

 23:002:003 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.

 23:002:004 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.

 23:002:005 O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.

 23:002:006 Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.

 23:002:007 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots:

 23:002:008 Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:

 23:002:009 And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.

 23:002:010 Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.

 23:002:011 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.

 23:002:012 For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:

 23:002:013 And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,

 23:002:014 And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,

 23:002:015 And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,

 23:002:016 And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.

 23:002:017 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.

 23:002:018 And the idols he shall utterly abolish.

 23:002:019 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

 23:002:020 In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;

 23:002:021 To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

 23:002:022 Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?

 23:003:001 For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water.

 23:003:002 The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,

 23:003:003 The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.

 23:003:004 And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.

 23:003:005 And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.

 23:003:006 When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand:

 23:003:007 In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.

 23:003:008 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.

 23:003:009 The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.

 23:003:010 Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.

 23:003:011 Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.

 23:003:012 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.

 23:003:013 The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.

 23:003:014 The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.

 23:003:015 What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

 23:003:016 Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:

 23:003:017 Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.

 23:003:018 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon,

 23:003:019 The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,

 23:003:020 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,

 23:003:021 The rings, and nose jewels,

 23:003:022 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,

 23:003:023 The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.

 23:003:024 And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.

 23:003:025 Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.

 23:003:026 And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.

 23:004:001 And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.

 23:004:002 In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.

 23:004:003 And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:

 23:004:004 When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.

 23:004:005 And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence.

 23:004:006 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.

 23:005:001 Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:

 23:005:002 And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.

 23:005:003 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.

 23:005:004 What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?

 23:005:005 And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:

 23:005:006 And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.

 23:005:007 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.

 23:005:008 Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!

 23:005:009 In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.

 23:005:010 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.

 23:005:011 Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!

 23:005:012 And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.

 23:005:013 Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.

 23:005:014 Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.

 23:005:015 And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:

 23:005:016 But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.

 23:005:017 Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.

 23:005:018 Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:

 23:005:019 That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!

 23:005:020 Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

 23:005:021 Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!

 23:005:022 Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:

 23:005:023 Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!

 23:005:024 Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

 23:005:025 Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

 23:005:026 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:

 23:005:027 None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:

 23:005:028 Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:

 23:005:029 Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.

 23:005:030 And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.

 23:006:001 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.

 23:006:002 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.

 23:006:003 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.

 23:006:004 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.

 23:006:005 Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.

 23:006:006 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:

 23:006:007 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.

 23:006:008 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.

 23:006:009 And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.

 23:006:010 Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.

 23:006:011 Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,

 23:006:012 And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.

 23:006:013 But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.

 23:007:001 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.

 23:007:002 And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.

 23:007:003 Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;

 23:007:004 And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.

 23:007:005 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,

 23:007:006 Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:

 23:007:007 Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.

 23:007:008 For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.

 23:007:009 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.

 23:007:010 Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,

 23:007:011 Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.

 23:007:012 But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.

 23:007:013 And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?

 23:007:014 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.

 23:007:015 Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.

 23:007:016 For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.

 23:007:017 The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.

 23:007:018 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

 23:007:019 And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.

 23:007:020 In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.

 23:007:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;

 23:007:022 And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.

 23:007:023 And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns.

 23:007:024 With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.

 23:007:025 And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.

 23:008:001 Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.

 23:008:002 And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

 23:008:003 And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.

 23:008:004 For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.

 23:008:005 The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,

 23:008:006 Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;

 23:008:007 Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:

 23:008:008 And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.

 23:008:009 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.

 23:008:010 Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.

 23:008:011 For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,

 23:008:012 Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.

 23:008:013 Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.

 23:008:014 And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

 23:008:015 And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.

 23:008:016 Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.

 23:008:017 And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.

 23:008:018 Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.

 23:008:019 And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?

 23:008:020 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.

 23:008:021 And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.

 23:008:022 And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness.

 23:009:001 Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.

 23:009:002 The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.

 23:009:003 Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.

 23:009:004 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.

 23:009:005 For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.

 23:009:006 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.

 23:009:007 Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.

 23:009:008 The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.

 23:009:009 And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,

 23:009:010 The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars.

 23:009:011 Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;

 23:009:012 The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

 23:009:013 For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.

 23:009:014 Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.

 23:009:015 The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.

 23:009:016 For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.

 23:009:017 Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

 23:009:018 For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.

 23:009:019 Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother.

 23:009:020 And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:

 23:009:021 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

 23:010:001 Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed;

 23:010:002 To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!

 23:010:003 And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?

 23:010:004 Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

 23:010:005 O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.

 23:010:006 I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.

 23:010:007 Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.

 23:010:008 For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?

 23:010:009 Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?

 23:010:010 As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;

 23:010:011 Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?

 23:010:012 Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.

 23:010:013 For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man:

 23:010:014 And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.

 23:010:015 Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.

 23:010:016 Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.

 23:010:017 And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;

 23:010:018 And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth.

 23:010:019 And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.

 23:010:020 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.

 23:010:021 The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.

 23:010:022 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.

 23:010:023 For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.

 23:010:024 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.

 23:010:025 For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction.

 23:010:026 And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.

 23:010:027 And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.

 23:010:028 He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages:

 23:010:029 They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.

 23:010:030 Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.

 23:010:031 Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.

 23:010:032 As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.

 23:010:033 Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.

 23:010:034 And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.

 23:011:001 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:

 23:011:002 And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;

 23:011:003 And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:

 23:011:004 But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.

 23:011:005 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.

 23:011:006 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.

 23:011:007 And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

 23:011:008 And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.

 23:011:009 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.

 23:011:010 And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.

 23:011:011 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.

 23:011:012 And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.

 23:011:013 The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.

 23:011:014 But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them.

 23:011:015 And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dryshod.

 23:011:016 And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.

 23:012:001 And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.

 23:012:002 Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.

 23:012:003 Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.

 23:012:004 And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.

 23:012:005 Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth.

 23:012:006 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.

 23:013:001 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

 23:013:002 Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.

 23:013:003 I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness.

 23:013:004 The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.

 23:013:005 They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.

 23:013:006 Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.

 23:013:007 Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:

 23:013:008 And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.

 23:013:009 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.

 23:013:010 For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.

 23:013:011 And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.

 23:013:012 I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.

 23:013:013 Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.

 23:013:014 And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land.

 23:013:015 Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.

 23:013:016 Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.

 23:013:017 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.

 23:013:018 Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall not spare children.

 23:013:019 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

 23:013:020 It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.

 23:013:021 But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.

 23:013:022 And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.

 23:014:001 For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.

 23:014:002 And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.

 23:014:003 And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,

 23:014:004 That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!

 23:014:005 The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the rulers.

 23:014:006 He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth.

 23:014:007 The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing.

 23:014:008 Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.

 23:014:009 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.

 23:014:010 All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?

 23:014:011 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.

 23:014:012 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!

 23:014:013 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:

 23:014:014 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.

 23:014:015 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.

 23:014:016 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;

 23:014:017 That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?

 23:014:018 All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.

 23:014:019 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.

 23:014:020 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.

 23:014:021 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.

 23:014:022 For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD.

 23:014:023 I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts.

 23:014:024 The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:

 23:014:025 That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.

 23:014:026 This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.

 23:014:027 For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

 23:014:028 In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.

 23:014:029 Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.

 23:014:030 And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant.

 23:014:031 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times.

 23:014:032 What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.

 23:015:001 The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;

 23:015:002 He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.

 23:015:003 In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.

 23:015:004 And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him.

 23:015:005 My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.

 23:015:006 For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.

 23:015:007 Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.

 23:015:008 For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beerelim.

 23:015:009 For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.

 23:016:001 Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.

 23:016:002 For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.

 23:016:003 Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.

 23:016:004 Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.

 23:016:005 And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.

 23:016:006 We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so.

 23:016:007 Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are stricken.

 23:016:008 For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.

 23:016:009 Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.

 23:016:010 And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.

 23:016:011 Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kirharesh.

 23:016:012 And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.

 23:016:013 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.

 23:016:014 But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and feeble.

 23:017:001 The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.

 23:017:002 The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

 23:017:003 The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts.

 23:017:004 And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.

 23:017:005 And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim.

 23:017:006 Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, saith the LORD God of Israel.

 23:017:007 At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.

 23:017:008 And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the images.

 23:017:009 In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel: and there shall be desolation.

 23:017:010 Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange slips:

 23:017:011 In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish: but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.

 23:017:012 Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!

 23:017:013 The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.

 23:017:014 And behold at eveningtide trouble; and before the morning he is not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them that rob us.

 23:018:001 Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia:

 23:018:002 That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!

 23:018:003 All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.

 23:018:004 For so the LORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.

 23:018:005 For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches.

 23:018:006 They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.

 23:018:007 In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.

 23:019:001 The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.

 23:019:002 And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.

 23:019:003 And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.

 23:019:004 And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts.

 23:019:005 And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.

 23:019:006 And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither.

 23:019:007 The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no more.

 23:019:008 The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.

 23:019:009 Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, shall be confounded.

 23:019:010 And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices and ponds for fish.

 23:019:011 Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?

 23:019:012 Where are they? where are thy wise men? and let them tell thee now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.

 23:019:013 The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof.

 23:019:014 The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof: and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit.

 23:019:015 Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or tail, branch or rush, may do.

 23:019:016 In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which he shaketh over it.

 23:019:017 And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it.

 23:019:018 In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The city of destruction.

 23:019:019 In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD.

 23:019:020 And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.

 23:019:021 And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform it.

 23:019:022 And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal it: and they shall return even to the LORD, and he shall be intreated of them, and shall heal them.

 23:019:023 In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.

 23:019:024 In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, even a blessing in the midst of the land:

 23:019:025 Whom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.

 23:020:001 In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;

 23:020:002 At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.

 23:020:003 And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia;

 23:020:004 So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.

 23:020:005 And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.

 23:020:006 And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?

 23:021:001 The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.

 23:021:002 A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.

 23:021:003 Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.

 23:021:004 My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.

 23:021:005 Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.

 23:021:006 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.

 23:021:007 And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:

 23:021:008 And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:

 23:021:009 And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.

 23:021:010 O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.

 23:021:011 The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?

 23:021:012 The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.

 23:021:013 The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.

 23:021:014 The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.

 23:021:015 For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.

 23:021:016 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:

 23:021:017 And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken it.

 23:022:001 The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?

 23:022:002 Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, joyous city: thy slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.

 23:022:003 All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, which have fled from far.

 23:022:004 Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people.

 23:022:005 For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.

 23:022:006 And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.

 23:022:007 And it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate.

 23:022:008 And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forest.

 23:022:009 Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.

 23:022:010 And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall.

 23:022:011 Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.

 23:022:012 And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:

 23:022:013 And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die.

 23:022:014 And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

 23:022:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say,

 23:022:016 What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high, and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock?

 23:022:017 Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity, and will surely cover thee.

 23:022:018 He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord's house.

 23:022:019 And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he pull thee down.

 23:022:020 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:

 23:022:021 And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.

 23:022:022 And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.

 23:022:023 And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.

 23:022:024 And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.

 23:022:025 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for the LORD hath spoken it.

 23:023:001 The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.

 23:023:002 Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.

 23:023:003 And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.

 23:023:004 Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.

 23:023:005 As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre.

 23:023:006 Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.

 23:023:007 Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.

 23:023:008 Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth?

 23:023:009 The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth.

 23:023:010 Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there is no more strength.

 23:023:011 He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant city, to destroy the strong holds thereof.

 23:023:012 And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou have no rest.

 23:023:013 Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and he brought it to ruin.

 23:023:014 Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.

 23:023:015 And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.

 23:023:016 Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.

 23:023:017 And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.

 23:023:018 And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.

 23:024:001 Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.

 23:024:002 And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.

 23:024:003 The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word.

 23:024:004 The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.

 23:024:005 The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.

 23:024:006 Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.

 23:024:007 The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh.

 23:024:008 The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.

 23:024:009 They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.

 23:024:010 The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.

 23:024:011 There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.

 23:024:012 In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.

 23:024:013 When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.

 23:024:014 They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.

 23:024:015 Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.

 23:024:016 From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.

 23:024:017 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.

 23:024:018 And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.

 23:024:019 The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.

 23:024:020 The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.

 23:024:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.

 23:024:022 And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.

 23:024:023 Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.

 23:025:001 O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth.

 23:025:002 For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.

 23:025:003 Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.

 23:025:004 For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.

 23:025:005 Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.

 23:025:006 And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.

 23:025:007 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.

 23:025:008 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it.

 23:025:009 And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

 23:025:010 For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.

 23:025:011 And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.

 23:025:012 And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.

 23:026:001 In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.

 23:026:002 Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.

 23:026:003 Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.

 23:026:004 Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength:

 23:026:005 For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust.

 23:026:006 The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.

 23:026:007 The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.

 23:026:008 Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.

 23:026:009 With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.

 23:026:010 Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.

 23:026:011 LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.

 23:026:012 LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.

 23:026:013 O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.

 23:026:014 They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.

 23:026:015 Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earth.

 23:026:016 LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them.

 23:026:017 Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD.

 23:026:018 We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.

 23:026:019 Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.

 23:026:020 Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.

 23:026:021 For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.

 23:027:001 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.

 23:027:002 In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.

 23:027:003 I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.

 23:027:004 Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together.

 23:027:005 Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.

 23:027:006 He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.

 23:027:007 Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him?

 23:027:008 In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it: he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.

 23:027:009 By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.

 23:027:010 Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the habitation forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.

 23:027:011 When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off: the women come, and set them on fire: for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no favour.

 23:027:012 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel.

 23:027:013 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.

 23:028:001 Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!

 23:028:002 Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.

 23:028:003 The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet:

 23:028:004 And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.

 23:028:005 In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,

 23:028:006 And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.

 23:028:007 But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.

 23:028:008 For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.

 23:028:009 Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.

 23:028:010 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:

 23:028:011 For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.

 23:028:012 To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.

 23:028:013 But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.

 23:028:014 Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem.

 23:028:015 Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:

 23:028:016 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.

 23:028:017 Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.

 23:028:018 And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.

 23:028:019 From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.

 23:028:020 For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.

 23:028:021 For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.

 23:028:022 Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.

 23:028:023 Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.

 23:028:024 Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground?

 23:028:025 When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place?

 23:028:026 For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.

 23:028:027 For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.

 23:028:028 Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen.

 23:028:029 This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.

 23:029:001 Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices.

 23:029:002 Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel.

 23:029:003 And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee.

 23:029:004 And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.

 23:029:005 Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.

 23:029:006 Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.

 23:029:007 And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.

 23:029:008 It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.

 23:029:009 Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.

 23:029:010 For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered.

 23:029:011 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed:

 23:029:012 And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.

 23:029:013 Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:

 23:029:014 Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.

 23:029:015 Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?

 23:029:016 Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?

 23:029:017 Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?

 23:029:018 And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.

 23:029:019 The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

 23:029:020 For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:

 23:029:021 That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.

 23:029:022 Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.

 23:029:023 But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.

 23:029:024 They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.

 23:030:001 Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:

 23:030:002 That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!

 23:030:003 Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.

 23:030:004 For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.

 23:030:005 They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.

 23:030:006 The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.

 23:030:007 For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.

 23:030:008 Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:

 23:030:009 That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD:

 23:030:010 Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:

 23:030:011 Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.

 23:030:012 Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:

 23:030:013 Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.

 23:030:014 And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit.

 23:030:015 For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.

 23:030:016 But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.

 23:030:017 One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.

 23:030:018 And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.

 23:030:019 For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.

 23:030:020 And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:

 23:030:021 And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.

 23:030:022 Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.

 23:030:023 Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.

 23:030:024 The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.

 23:030:025 And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.

 23:030:026 Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.

 23:030:027 Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:

 23:030:028 And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.

 23:030:029 Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.

 23:030:030 And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.

 23:030:031 For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod.

 23:030:032 And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.

 23:030:033 For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.

 23:031:001 Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!

 23:031:002 Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.

 23:031:003 Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.

 23:031:004 For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.

 23:031:005 As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it.

 23:031:006 Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.

 23:031:007 For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin.

 23:031:008 Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited.

 23:031:009 And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.

 23:032:001 Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.

 23:032:002 And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.

 23:032:003 And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.

 23:032:004 The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.

 23:032:005 The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful.

 23:032:006 For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.

 23:032:007 The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.

 23:032:008 But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand.

 23:032:009 Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear unto my speech.

 23:032:010 Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.

 23:032:011 Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins.

 23:032:012 They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.

 23:032:013 Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:

 23:032:014 Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;

 23:032:015 Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.

 23:032:016 Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.

 23:032:017 And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.

 23:032:018 And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;

 23:032:019 When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.

 23:032:020 Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass.

 23:033:001 Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.

 23:033:002 O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.

 23:033:003 At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.

 23:033:004 And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.

 23:033:005 The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.

 23:033:006 And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.

 23:033:007 Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.

 23:033:008 The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.

 23:033:009 The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.

 23:033:010 Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.

 23:033:011 Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as fire, shall devour you.

 23:033:012 And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.

 23:033:013 Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.

 23:033:014 The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?

 23:033:015 He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;

 23:033:016 He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.

 23:033:017 Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.

 23:033:018 Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers?

 23:033:019 Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand.

 23:033:020 Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.

 23:033:021 But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.

 23:033:022 For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us.

 23:033:023 Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.

 23:033:024 And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.

 23:034:001 Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it.

 23:034:002 For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.

 23:034:003 Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.

 23:034:004 And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.

 23:034:005 For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.

 23:034:006 The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.

 23:034:007 And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.

 23:034:008 For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.

 23:034:009 And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.

 23:034:010 It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.

 23:034:011 But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.

 23:034:012 They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there, and all her princes shall be nothing.

 23:034:013 And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, and a court for owls.

 23:034:014 The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.

 23:034:015 There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.

 23:034:016 Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.

 23:034:017 And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.

 23:035:001 The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.

 23:035:002 It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, and the excellency of our God.

 23:035:003 Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.

 23:035:004 Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you.

 23:035:005 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.

 23:035:006 Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.

 23:035:007 And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.

 23:035:008 And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.

 23:035:009 No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:

 23:035:010 And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.

 23:036:001 Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them.

 23:036:002 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.

 23:036:003 Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.

 23:036:004 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?

 23:036:005 I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?

 23:036:006 Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.

 23:036:007 But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?

 23:036:008 Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.

 23:036:009 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?

 23:036:010 And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.

 23:036:011 Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.

 23:036:012 But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?

 23:036:013 Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.

 23:036:014 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.

 23:036:015 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

 23:036:016 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;

 23:036:017 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

 23:036:018 Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

 23:036:019 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?

 23:036:020 Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?

 23:036:021 But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.

 23:036:022 Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

 23:037:001 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.

 23:037:002 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

 23:037:003 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.

 23:037:004 It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.

 23:037:005 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

 23:037:006 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.

 23:037:007 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.

 23:037:008 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.

 23:037:009 And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

 23:037:010 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.

 23:037:011 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?

 23:037:012 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?

 23:037:013 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?

 23:037:014 And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.

 23:037:015 And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,

 23:037:016 O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.

 23:037:017 Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God.

 23:037:018 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,

 23:037:019 And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.

 23:037:020 Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD, even thou only.

 23:037:021 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:

 23:037:022 This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.

 23:037:023 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.

 23:037:024 By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.

 23:037:025 I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.

 23:037:026 Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps.

 23:037:027 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.

 23:037:028 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.

 23:037:029 Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.

 23:037:030 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.

 23:037:031 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:

 23:037:032 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.

 23:037:033 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.

 23:037:034 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.

 23:037:035 For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.

 23:037:036 Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.

 23:037:037 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.

 23:037:038 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

 23:038:001 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.

 23:038:002 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,

 23:038:003 And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.

 23:038:004 Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,

 23:038:005 Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.

 23:038:006 And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.

 23:038:007 And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;

 23:038:008 Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.

 23:038:009 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:

 23:038:010 I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.

 23:038:011 I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.

 23:038:012 Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.

 23:038:013 I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.

 23:038:014 Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.

 23:038:015 What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.

 23:038:016 O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.

 23:038:017 Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.

 23:038:018 For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.

 23:038:019 The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.

 23:038:020 The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.

 23:038:021 For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.

 23:038:022 Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?

 23:039:001 At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.

 23:039:002 And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.

 23:039:003 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.

 23:039:004 Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.

 23:039:005 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:

 23:039:006 Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.

 23:039:007 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.

 23:039:008 Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.

 23:040:001 Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.

 23:040:002 Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.

 23:040:003 The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.

 23:040:004 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:

 23:040:005 And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.

 23:040:006 The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:

 23:040:007 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.

 23:040:008 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.

 23:040:009 O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!

 23:040:010 Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.

 23:040:011 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.

 23:040:012 Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?

 23:040:013 Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counsellor hath taught him?

 23:040:014 With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?

 23:040:015 Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.

 23:040:016 And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.

 23:040:017 All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.

 23:040:018 To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?

 23:040:019 The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.

 23:040:020 He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.

 23:040:021 Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?

 23:040:022 It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:

 23:040:023 That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.

 23:040:024 Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.

 23:040:025 To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.

 23:040:026 Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth.

 23:040:027 Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?

 23:040:028 Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.

 23:040:029 He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.

 23:040:030 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:

 23:040:031 But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.

 23:041:001 Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near together to judgment.

 23:041:002 Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow.

 23:041:003 He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he had not gone with his feet.

 23:041:004 Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.

 23:041:005 The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.

 23:041:006 They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his brother, Be of good courage.

 23:041:007 So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.

 23:041:008 But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.

 23:041:009 Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.

 23:041:010 Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.

 23:041:011 Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish.

 23:041:012 Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.

 23:041:013 For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.

 23:041:014 Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.

 23:041:015 Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.

 23:041:016 Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.

 23:041:017 When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.

 23:041:018 I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.

 23:041:019 I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together:

 23:041:020 That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.

 23:041:021 Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong reasons, saith the King of Jacob.

 23:041:022 Let them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen: let them shew the former things, what they be, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.

 23:041:023 Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.

 23:041:024 Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an abomination is he that chooseth you.

 23:041:025 I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes as upon morter, and as the potter treadeth clay.

 23:041:026 Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is none that sheweth, yea, there is none that declareth, yea, there is none that heareth your words.

 23:041:027 The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.

 23:041:028 For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there was no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.

 23:041:029 Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion.

 23:042:001 Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.

 23:042:002 He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.

 23:042:003 A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.

 23:042:004 He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.

 23:042:005 Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:

 23:042:006 I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;

 23:042:007 To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.

 23:042:008 I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.

 23:042:009 Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.

 23:042:010 Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.

 23:042:011 Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.

 23:042:012 Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.

 23:042:013 The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.

 23:042:014 I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.

 23:042:015 I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.

 23:042:016 And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.

 23:042:017 They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods.

 23:042:018 Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.

 23:042:019 Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD's servant?

 23:042:020 Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.

 23:042:021 The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.

 23:042:022 But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.

 23:042:023 Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for the time to come?

 23:042:024 Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.

 23:042:025 Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.

 23:043:001 But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.

 23:043:002 When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.

 23:043:003 For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.

 23:043:004 Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.

 23:043:005 Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;

 23:043:006 I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;

 23:043:007 Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.

 23:043:008 Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.

 23:043:009 Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.

 23:043:010 Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.

 23:043:011 I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.

 23:043:012 I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I am God.

 23:043:013 Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?

 23:043:014 Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.

 23:043:015 I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.

 23:043:016 Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;

 23:043:017 Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.

 23:043:018 Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.

 23:043:019 Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.

 23:043:020 The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.

 23:043:021 This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.

 23:043:022 But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.

 23:043:023 Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.

 23:043:024 Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.

 23:043:025 I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.

 23:043:026 Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.

 23:043:027 Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.

 23:043:028 Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.

 23:044:001 Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:

 23:044:002 Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.

 23:044:003 For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:

 23:044:004 And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.

 23:044:005 One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.

 23:044:006 Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.

 23:044:007 And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.

 23:044:008 Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.

 23:044:009 They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.

 23:044:010 Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?

 23:044:011 Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed together.

 23:044:012 The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.

 23:044:013 The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.

 23:044:014 He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.

 23:044:015 Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.

 23:044:016 He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:

 23:044:017 And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.

 23:044:018 They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.

 23:044:019 And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?

 23:044:020 He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?

 23:044:021 Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.

 23:044:022 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.

 23:044:023 Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.

 23:044:024 Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;

 23:044:025 That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;

 23:044:026 That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:

 23:044:027 That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:

 23:044:028 That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.

 23:045:001 Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;

 23:045:002 I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:

 23:045:003 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.

 23:045:004 For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.

 23:045:005 I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:

 23:045:006 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.

 23:045:007 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.

 23:045:008 Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it.

 23:045:009 Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?

 23:045:010 Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?

 23:045:011 Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.

 23:045:012 I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.

 23:045:013 I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.

 23:045:014 Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying, Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no God.

 23:045:015 Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.

 23:045:016 They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.

 23:045:017 But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.

 23:045:018 For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.

 23:045:019 I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.

 23:045:020 Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.

 23:045:021 Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.

 23:045:022 Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.

 23:045:023 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.

 23:045:024 Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.

 23:045:025 In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.

 23:046:001 Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy loaden; they are a burden to the weary beast.

 23:046:002 They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.

 23:046:003 Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb:

 23:046:004 And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.

 23:046:005 To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?

 23:046:006 They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea, they worship.

 23:046:007 They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.

 23:046:008 Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors.

 23:046:009 Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me,

 23:046:010 Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:

 23:046:011 Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.

 23:046:012 Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from righteousness:

 23:046:013 I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.

 23:047:001 Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.

 23:047:002 Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.

 23:047:003 Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man.

 23:047:004 As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.

 23:047:005 Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.

 23:047:006 I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.

 23:047:007 And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.

 23:047:008 Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:

 23:047:009 But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great abundance of thine enchantments.

 23:047:010 For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.

 23:047:011 Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know.

 23:047:012 Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.

 23:047:013 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.

 23:047:014 Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.

 23:047:015 Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.

 23:048:001 Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.

 23:048:002 For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.

 23:048:003 I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.

 23:048:004 Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;

 23:048:005 I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.

 23:048:006 Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.

 23:048:007 They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.

 23:048:008 Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.

 23:048:009 For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.

 23:048:010 Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.

 23:048:011 For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.

 23:048:012 Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.

 23:048:013 Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.

 23:048:014 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.

 23:048:015 I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.

 23:048:016 Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.

 23:048:017 Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.

 23:048:018 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:

 23:048:019 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.

 23:048:020 Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob.

 23:048:021 And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.

 23:048:022 There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.

 23:049:001 Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name.

 23:049:002 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;

 23:049:003 And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.

 23:049:004 Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God.

 23:049:005 And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.

 23:049:006 And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.

 23:049:007 Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.

 23:049:008 Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;

 23:049:009 That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.

 23:049:010 They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.

 23:049:011 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.

 23:049:012 Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.

 23:049:013 Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.

 23:049:014 But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.

 23:049:015 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.

 23:049:016 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.

 23:049:017 Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.

 23:049:018 Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride doeth.

 23:049:019 For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.

 23:049:020 The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.

 23:049:021 Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?

 23:049:022 Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.

 23:049:023 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.

 23:049:024 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?

 23:049:025 But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.

 23:049:026 And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

 23:050:001 Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.

 23:050:002 Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst.

 23:050:003 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.

 23:050:004 The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.

 23:050:005 The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.

 23:050:006 I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.

 23:050:007 For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.

 23:050:008 He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me.

 23:050:009 Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.

 23:050:010 Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.

 23:050:011 Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.

 23:051:001 Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.

 23:051:002 Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.

 23:051:003 For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.

 23:051:004 Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.

 23:051:005 My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.

 23:051:006 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.

 23:051:007 Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.

 23:051:008 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.

 23:051:009 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?

 23:051:010 Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?

 23:051:011 Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.

 23:051:012 I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;

 23:051:013 And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?

 23:051:014 The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.

 23:051:015 But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.

 23:051:016 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.

 23:051:017 Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.

 23:051:018 There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.

 23:051:019 These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?

 23:051:020 Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.

 23:051:021 Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:

 23:051:022 Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:

 23:051:023 But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.

 23:052:001 Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.

 23:052:002 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.

 23:052:003 For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.

 23:052:004 For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.

 23:052:005 Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.

 23:052:006 Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.

 23:052:007 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!

 23:052:008 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.

 23:052:009 Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.

 23:052:010 The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.

 23:052:011 Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.

 23:052:012 For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rereward.

 23:052:013 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.

 23:052:014 As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:

 23:052:015 So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.

 23:053:001 Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?

 23:053:002 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.

 23:053:003 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.

 23:053:004 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

 23:053:005 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.

 23:053:006 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.

 23:053:007 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.

 23:053:008 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.

 23:053:009 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.

 23:053:010 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.

 23:053:011 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.

 23:053:012 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

 23:054:001 Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.

 23:054:002 Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;

 23:054:003 For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.

 23:054:004 Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.

 23:054:005 For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.

 23:054:006 For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.

 23:054:007 For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.

 23:054:008 In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.

 23:054:009 For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.

 23:054:010 For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.

 23:054:011 O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.

 23:054:012 And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.

 23:054:013 And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of thy children.

 23:054:014 In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.

 23:054:015 Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.

 23:054:016 Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.

 23:054:017 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.

 23:055:001 Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.

 23:055:002 Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.

 23:055:003 Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.

 23:055:004 Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.

 23:055:005 Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.

 23:055:006 Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:

 23:055:007 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

 23:055:008 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.

 23:055:009 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

 23:055:010 For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:

 23:055:011 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.

 23:055:012 For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.

 23:055:013 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.

 23:056:001 Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.

 23:056:002 Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.

 23:056:003 Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.

 23:056:004 For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;

 23:056:005 Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.

 23:056:006 Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;

 23:056:007 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.

 23:056:008 The Lord GOD, which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.

 23:056:009 All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in the forest.

 23:056:010 His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.

 23:056:011 Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.

 23:056:012 Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.

 23:057:001 The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.

 23:057:002 He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.

 23:057:003 But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore.

 23:057:004 Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood.

 23:057:005 Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?

 23:057:006 Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?

 23:057:007 Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.

 23:057:008 Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.

 23:057:009 And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase thyself even unto hell.

 23:057:010 Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.

 23:057:011 And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?

 23:057:012 I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.

 23:057:013 When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;

 23:057:014 And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.

 23:057:015 For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.

 23:057:016 For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.

 23:057:017 For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.

 23:057:018 I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.

 23:057:019 I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.

 23:057:020 But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.

 23:057:021 There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.

 23:058:001 Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.

 23:058:002 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.

 23:058:003 Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.

 23:058:004 Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.

 23:058:005 Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?

 23:058:006 Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?

 23:058:007 Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?

 23:058:008 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward.

 23:058:009 Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;

 23:058:010 And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon day:

 23:058:011 And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.

 23:058:012 And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.

 23:058:013 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:

 23:058:014 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.

 23:059:001 Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:

 23:059:002 But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.

 23:059:003 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.

 23:059:004 None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.

 23:059:005 They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.

 23:059:006 Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.

 23:059:007 Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths.

 23:059:008 The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.

 23:059:009 Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.

 23:059:010 We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.

 23:059:011 We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.

 23:059:012 For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;

 23:059:013 In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.

 23:059:014 And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.

 23:059:015 Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.

 23:059:016 And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.

 23:059:017 For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.

 23:059:018 According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.

 23:059:019 So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.

 23:059:020 And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.

 23:059:021 As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.

 23:060:001 Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.

 23:060:002 For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.

 23:060:003 And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.

 23:060:004 Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.

 23:060:005 Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee.

 23:060:006 The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall shew forth the praises of the LORD.

 23:060:007 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.

 23:060:008 Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?

 23:060:009 Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.

 23:060:010 And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee.

 23:060:011 Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought.

 23:060:012 For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.

 23:060:013 The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.

 23:060:014 The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee; The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.

 23:060:015 Whereas thou has been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.

 23:060:016 Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

 23:060:017 For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness.

 23:060:018 Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.

 23:060:019 The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.

 23:060:020 Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.

 23:060:021 Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.

 23:060:022 A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time.

 23:061:001 The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;

 23:061:002 To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;

 23:061:003 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.

 23:061:004 And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.

 23:061:005 And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.

 23:061:006 But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.

 23:061:007 For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.

 23:061:008 For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.

 23:061:009 And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed.

 23:061:010 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.

 23:061:011 For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.

 23:062:001 For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.

 23:062:002 And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name.

 23:062:003 Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.

 23:062:004 Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.

 23:062:005 For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.

 23:062:006 I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence,

 23:062:007 And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.

 23:062:008 The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured:

 23:062:009 But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.

 23:062:010 Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.

 23:062:011 Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.

 23:062:012 And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.

 23:063:001 Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.

 23:063:002 Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?

 23:063:003 I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.

 23:063:004 For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.

 23:063:005 And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.

 23:063:006 And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.

 23:063:007 I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.

 23:063:008 For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their Saviour.

 23:063:009 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.

 23:063:010 But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.

 23:063:011 Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?

 23:063:012 That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?

 23:063:013 That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble?

 23:063:014 As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.

 23:063:015 Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?

 23:063:016 Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our father, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.

 23:063:017 O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.

 23:063:018 The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.

 23:063:019 We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name.

 23:064:001 Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,

 23:064:002 As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!

 23:064:003 When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.

 23:064:004 For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.

 23:064:005 Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.

 23:064:006 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.

 23:064:007 And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.

 23:064:008 But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.

 23:064:009 Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.

 23:064:010 Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.

 23:064:011 Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.

 23:064:012 Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?

 23:065:001 I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.

 23:065:002 I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;

 23:065:003 A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;

 23:065:004 Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;

 23:065:005 Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.

 23:065:006 Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,

 23:065:007 Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.

 23:065:008 Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.

 23:065:009 And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.

 23:065:010 And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.

 23:065:011 But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.

 23:065:012 Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.

 23:065:013 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:

 23:065:014 Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.

 23:065:015 And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:

 23:065:016 That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.

 23:065:017 For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.

 23:065:018 But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.

 23:065:019 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.

 23:065:020 There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.

 23:065:021 And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.

 23:065:022 They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.

 23:065:023 They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.

 23:065:024 And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.

 23:065:025 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.

 23:066:001 Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?

 23:066:002 For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.

 23:066:003 He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.

 23:066:004 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.

 23:066:005 Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.

 23:066:006 A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies.

 23:066:007 Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.

 23:066:008 Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.

 23:066:009 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God.

 23:066:010 Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:

 23:066:011 That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.

 23:066:012 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.

 23:066:013 As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.

 23:066:014 And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.

 23:066:015 For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.

 23:066:016 For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.

 23:066:017 They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.

 23:066:018 For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.

 23:066:019 And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.

 23:066:020 And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.

 23:066:021 And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the LORD.

 23:066:022 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.

 23:066:023 And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.

 23:066:024 And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.

 Book 24 Jeremiah

 24:001:001 The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:

 24:001:002 To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.

 24:001:003 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.

 24:001:004 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 24:001:005 Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.

 24:001:006 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.

 24:001:007 But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.

 24:001:008 Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD.

 24:001:009 Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.

 24:001:010 See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.

 24:001:011 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.

 24:001:012 Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.

 24:001:013 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the north.

 24:001:014 Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.

 24:001:015 For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.

 24:001:016 And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.

 24:001:017 Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.

 24:001:018 For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.

 24:001:019 And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.

 24:002:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

 24:002:002 Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.

 24:002:003 Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the LORD.

 24:002:004 Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:

 24:002:005 Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?

 24:002:006 Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?

 24:002:007 And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.

 24:002:008 The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.

 24:002:009 Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.

 24:002:010 For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.

 24:002:011 Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.

 24:002:012 Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD.

 24:002:013 For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.

 24:002:014 Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled?

 24:002:015 The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.

 24:002:016 Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.

 24:002:017 Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?

 24:002:018 And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?

 24:002:019 Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

 24:002:020 For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.

 24:002:021 Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?

 24:002:022 For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.

 24:002:023 How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways;

 24:002:024 A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.

 24:002:025 Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.

 24:002:026 As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets.

 24:002:027 Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.

 24:002:028 But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.

 24:002:029 Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the LORD.

 24:002:030 In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.

 24:002:031 O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?

 24:002:032 Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.

 24:002:033 Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.

 24:002:034 Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.

 24:002:035 Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.

 24:002:036 Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.

 24:002:037 Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.

 24:003:001 They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the LORD.

 24:003:002 Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.

 24:003:003 Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.

 24:003:004 Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the guide of my youth?

 24:003:005 Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest.

 24:003:006 The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.

 24:003:007 And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.

 24:003:008 And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.

 24:003:009 And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.

 24:003:010 And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD.

 24:003:011 And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah.

 24:003:012 Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.

 24:003:013 Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the LORD.

 24:003:014 Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:

 24:003:015 And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.

 24:003:016 And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.

 24:003:017 At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.

 24:003:018 In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.

 24:003:019 But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me.

 24:003:020 Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the LORD.

 24:003:021 A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the LORD their God.

 24:003:022 Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the LORD our God.

 24:003:023 Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel.

 24:003:024 For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.

 24:003:025 We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.

 24:004:001 If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove.

 24:004:002 And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.

 24:004:003 For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.

 24:004:004 Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.

 24:004:005 Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.

 24:004:006 Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.

 24:004:007 The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.

 24:004:008 For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.

 24:004:009 And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.

 24:004:010 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.

 24:004:011 At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,

 24:004:012 Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.

 24:004:013 Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.

 24:004:014 O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?

 24:004:015 For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.

 24:004:016 Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.

 24:004:017 As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.

 24:004:018 Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart.

 24:004:019 My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.

 24:004:020 Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.

 24:004:021 How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?

 24:004:022 For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.

 24:004:023 I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.

 24:004:024 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.

 24:004:025 I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.

 24:004:026 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.

 24:004:027 For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.

 24:004:028 For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.

 24:004:029 The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.

 24:004:030 And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life.

 24:004:031 For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.

 24:005:001 Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.

 24:005:002 And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.

 24:005:003 O LORD, are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.

 24:005:004 Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, nor the judgment of their God.

 24:005:005 I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD, and the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.

 24:005:006 Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.

 24:005:007 How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.

 24:005:008 They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife.

 24:005:009 Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

 24:005:010 Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they are not the LORD's.

 24:005:011 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD.

 24:005:012 They have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:

 24:005:013 And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.

 24:005:014 Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.

 24:005:015 Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the LORD: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.

 24:005:016 Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.

 24:005:017 And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.

 24:005:018 Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.

 24:005:019 And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these things unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not your's.

 24:005:020 Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,

 24:005:021 Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:

 24:005:022 Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?

 24:005:023 But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.

 24:005:024 Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.

 24:005:025 Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good things from you.

 24:005:026 For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.

 24:005:027 As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.

 24:005:028 They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.

 24:005:029 Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

 24:005:030 A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;

 24:005:031 The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?

 24:006:001 O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction.

 24:006:002 I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.

 24:006:003 The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.

 24:006:004 Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.

 24:006:005 Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.

 24:006:006 For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.

 24:006:007 As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds.

 24:006:008 Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.

 24:006:009 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.

 24:006:010 To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.

 24:006:011 Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.

 24:006:012 And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.

 24:006:013 For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.

 24:006:014 They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.

 24:006:015 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.

 24:006:016 Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.

 24:006:017 Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.

 24:006:018 Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.

 24:006:019 Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.

 24:006:020 To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.

 24:006:021 Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.

 24:006:022 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.

 24:006:023 They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.

 24:006:024 We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.

 24:006:025 Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side.

 24:006:026 O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.

 24:006:027 I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.

 24:006:028 They are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they are brass and iron; they are all corrupters.

 24:006:029 The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.

 24:006:030 Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the LORD hath rejected them.

 24:007:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

 24:007:002 Stand in the gate of the LORD's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD.

 24:007:003 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.

 24:007:004 Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these.

 24:007:005 For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;

 24:007:006 If ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:

 24:007:007 Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.

 24:007:008 Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.

 24:007:009 Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;

 24:007:010 And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?

 24:007:011 Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the LORD.

 24:007:012 But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.

 24:007:013 And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;

 24:007:014 Therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.

 24:007:015 And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.

 24:007:016 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.

 24:007:017 Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?

 24:007:018 The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.

 24:007:019 Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?

 24:007:020 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.

 24:007:021 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.

 24:007:022 For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:

 24:007:023 But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.

 24:007:024 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.

 24:007:025 Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:

 24:007:026 Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.

 24:007:027 Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.

 24:007:028 But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.

 24:007:029 Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.

 24:007:030 For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.

 24:007:031 And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.

 24:007:032 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.

 24:007:033 And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away.

 24:007:034 Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.

 24:008:001 At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:

 24:008:002 And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.

 24:008:003 And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts.

 24:008:004 Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?

 24:008:005 Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.

 24:008:006 I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.

 24:008:007 Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.

 24:008:008 How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain.

 24:008:009 The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them?

 24:008:010 Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.

 24:008:011 For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.

 24:008:012 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.

 24:008:013 I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.

 24:008:014 Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.

 24:008:015 We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble!

 24:008:016 The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein.

 24:008:017 For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD.

 24:008:018 When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me.

 24:008:019 Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with strange vanities?

 24:008:020 The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.

 24:008:021 For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.

 24:008:022 Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?

 24:009:001 Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!

 24:009:002 Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.

 24:009:003 And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.

 24:009:004 Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.

 24:009:005 And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity.

 24:009:006 Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.

 24:009:007 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?

 24:009:008 Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait.

 24:009:009 Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

 24:009:010 For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.

 24:009:011 And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.

 24:009:012 Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through?

 24:009:013 And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;

 24:009:014 But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them:

 24:009:015 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.

 24:009:016 I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.

 24:009:017 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that they may come:

 24:009:018 And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.

 24:009:019 For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast us out.

 24:009:020 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.

 24:009:021 For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets.

 24:009:022 Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather them.

 24:009:023 Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches:

 24:009:024 But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the LORD.

 24:009:025 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised;

 24:009:026 Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.

 24:010:001 Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:

 24:010:002 Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.

 24:010:003 For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.

 24:010:004 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.

 24:010:005 They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.

 24:010:006 Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.

 24:010:007 Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.

 24:010:008 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.

 24:010:009 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.

 24:010:010 But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.

 24:010:011 Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.

 24:010:012 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.

 24:010:013 When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.

 24:010:014 Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.

 24:010:015 They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.

 24:010:016 The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.

 24:010:017 Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.

 24:010:018 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.

 24:010:019 Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.

 24:010:020 My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.

 24:010:021 For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.

 24:010:022 Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.

 24:010:023 O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.

 24:010:024 O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.

 24:010:025 Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.

 24:011:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying,

 24:011:002 Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;

 24:011:003 And say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant,

 24:011:004 Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:

 24:011:005 That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.

 24:011:006 Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.

 24:011:007 For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.

 24:011:008 Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do: but they did them not.

 24:011:009 And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

 24:011:010 They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.

 24:011:011 Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.

 24:011:012 Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.

 24:011:013 For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.

 24:011:014 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.

 24:011:015 What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.

 24:011:016 The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.

 24:011:017 For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.

 24:011:018 And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then thou shewedst me their doings.

 24:011:019 But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.

 24:011:020 But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.

 24:011:021 Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand:

 24:011:022 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:

 24:011:023 And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.

 24:012:001 Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?

 24:012:002 Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.

 24:012:003 But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.

 24:012:004 How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.

 24:012:005 If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?

 24:012:006 For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.

 24:012:007 I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.

 24:012:008 Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.

 24:012:009 Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round about are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.

 24:012:010 Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.

 24:012:011 They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart.

 24:012:012 The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.

 24:012:013 They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.

 24:012:014 Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.

 24:012:015 And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.

 24:012:016 And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people.

 24:012:017 But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD.

 24:013:001 Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.

 24:013:002 So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it on my loins.

 24:013:003 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,

 24:013:004 Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.

 24:013:005 So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.

 24:013:006 And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.

 24:013:007 Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.

 24:013:008 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 24:013:009 Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.

 24:013:010 This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing.

 24:013:011 For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.

 24:013:012 Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?

 24:013:013 Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.

 24:013:014 And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.

 24:013:015 Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.

 24:013:016 Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.

 24:013:017 But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the LORD's flock is carried away captive.

 24:013:018 Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory.

 24:013:019 The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive.

 24:013:020 Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?

 24:013:021 What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?

 24:013:022 And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare.

 24:013:023 Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.

 24:013:024 Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness.

 24:013:025 This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.

 24:013:026 Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear.

 24:013:027 I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be?

 24:014:001 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.

 24:014:002 Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.

 24:014:003 And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.

 24:014:004 Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.

 24:014:005 Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no grass.

 24:014:006 And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no grass.

 24:014:007 O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.

 24:014:008 O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?

 24:014:009 Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.

 24:014:010 Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.

 24:014:011 Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their good.

 24:014:012 When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.

 24:014:013 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.

 24:014:014 Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.

 24:014:015 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.

 24:014:016 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.

 24:014:017 Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.

 24:014:018 If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.

 24:014:019 Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!

 24:014:020 We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.

 24:014:021 Do not abhor us, for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.

 24:014:022 Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these things.

 24:015:001 Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.

 24:015:002 And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity.

 24:015:003 And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.

 24:015:004 And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.

 24:015:005 For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?

 24:015:006 Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.

 24:015:007 And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people since they return not from their ways.

 24:015:008 Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.

 24:015:009 She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD.

 24:015:010 Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse me.

 24:015:011 The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.

 24:015:012 Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?

 24:015:013 Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.

 24:015:014 And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.

 24:015:015 O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.

 24:015:016 Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.

 24:015:017 I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.

 24:015:018 Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail?

 24:015:019 Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.

 24:015:020 And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.

 24:015:021 And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.

 24:016:001 The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying,

 24:016:002 Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place.

 24:016:003 For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land;

 24:016:004 They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.

 24:016:005 For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the LORD, even lovingkindness and mercies.

 24:016:006 Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:

 24:016:007 Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.

 24:016:008 Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.

 24:016:009 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.

 24:016:010 And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?

 24:016:011 Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;

 24:016:012 And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me:

 24:016:013 Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I will not shew you favour.

 24:016:014 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;

 24:016:015 But, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.

 24:016:016 Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.

 24:016:017 For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.

 24:016:018 And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things.

 24:016:019 O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.

 24:016:020 Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?

 24:016:021 Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is The LORD.

 24:017:001 The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars;

 24:017:002 Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills.

 24:017:003 O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for sin, throughout all thy borders.

 24:017:004 And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn for ever.

 24:017:005 Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.

 24:017:006 For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.

 24:017:007 Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.

 24:017:008 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.

 24:017:009 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?

 24:017:010 I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.

 24:017:011 As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.

 24:017:012 A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.

 24:017:013 O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.

 24:017:014 Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise.

 24:017:015 Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it come now.

 24:017:016 As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was right before thee.

 24:017:017 Be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil.

 24:017:018 Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.

 24:017:019 Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;

 24:017:020 And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:

 24:017:021 Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;

 24:017:022 Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.

 24:017:023 But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.

 24:017:024 And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;

 24:017:025 Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever.

 24:017:026 And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD.

 24:017:027 But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.

 24:018:001 The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

 24:018:002 Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.

 24:018:003 Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.

 24:018:004 And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.

 24:018:005 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

 24:018:006 O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.

 24:018:007 At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it;

 24:018:008 If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.

 24:018:009 And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;

 24:018:010 If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.

 24:018:011 Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.

 24:018:012 And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.

 24:018:013 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.

 24:018:014 Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?

 24:018:015 Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;

 24:018:016 To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.

 24:018:017 I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.

 24:018:018 Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.

 24:018:019 Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.

 24:018:020 Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them.

 24:018:021 Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle.

 24:018:022 Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.

 24:018:023 Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with them in the time of thine anger.

 24:019:001 Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter's earthen bottle, and take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests;

 24:019:002 And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee,

 24:019:003 And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.

 24:019:004 Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents;

 24:019:005 They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:

 24:019:006 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter.

 24:019:007 And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.

 24:019:008 And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.

 24:019:009 And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.

 24:019:010 Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee,

 24:019:011 And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury.

 24:019:012 Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet:

 24:019:013 And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods.

 24:019:014 Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD's house; and said to all the people,

 24:019:015 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.

 24:020:001 Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.

 24:020:002 Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD.

 24:020:003 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magormissabib.

 24:020:004 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.

 24:020:005 Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.

 24:020:006 And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.

 24:020:007 O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived; thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me.

 24:020:008 For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily.

 24:020:009 Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.

 24:020:010 For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.

 24:020:011 But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.

 24:020:012 But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened my cause.

 24:020:013 Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.

 24:020:014 Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.

 24:020:015 Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.

 24:020:016 And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide;

 24:020:017 Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb to be always great with me.

 24:020:018 Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?

 24:021:001 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,

 24:021:002 Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.

 24:021:003 Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:

 24:021:004 Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.

 24:021:005 And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.

 24:021:006 And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.

 24:021:007 And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.

 24:021:008 And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.

 24:021:009 He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.

 24:021:010 For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.

 24:021:011 And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the word of the LORD;

 24:021:012 O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.

 24:021:013 Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?

 24:021:014 But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the LORD: and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it.

 24:022:001 Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,

 24:022:002 And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates:

 24:022:003 Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place.

 24:022:004 For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.

 24:022:005 But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.

 24:022:006 For thus saith the LORD unto the king's house of Judah; Thou art Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon: yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited.

 24:022:007 And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.

 24:022:008 And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city?

 24:022:009 Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.

 24:022:010 Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.

 24:022:011 For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more:

 24:022:012 But he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.

 24:022:013 Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;

 24:022:014 That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is cieled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.

 24:022:015 Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him?

 24:022:016 He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me? saith the LORD.

 24:022:017 But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.

 24:022:018 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!

 24:022:019 He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.

 24:022:020 Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.

 24:022:021 I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.

 24:022:022 The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.

 24:022:023 O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!

 24:022:024 As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;

 24:022:025 And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.

 24:022:026 And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.

 24:022:027 But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they not return.

 24:022:028 Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?

 24:022:029 O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.

 24:022:030 Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.

 24:023:001 Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the LORD.

 24:023:002 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD.

 24:023:003 And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.

 24:023:004 And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD.

 24:023:005 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.

 24:023:006 In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.

 24:023:007 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;

 24:023:008 But, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.

 24:023:009 Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness.

 24:023:010 For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is not right.

 24:023:011 For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the LORD.

 24:023:012 Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.

 24:023:013 And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.

 24:023:014 I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness; they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.

 24:023:015 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.

 24:023:016 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the LORD.

 24:023:017 They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.

 24:023:018 For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard it?

 24:023:019 Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.

 24:023:020 The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.

 24:023:021 I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.

 24:023:022 But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.

 24:023:023 Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off?

 24:023:024 Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD.

 24:023:025 I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.

 24:023:026 How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart;

 24:023:027 Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.

 24:023:028 The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD.

 24:023:029 Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?

 24:023:030 Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbour.

 24:023:031 Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.

 24:023:032 Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD.

 24:023:033 And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD.

 24:023:034 And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house.

 24:023:035 Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken?

 24:023:036 And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.

 24:023:037 Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken?

 24:023:038 But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD; Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD;

 24:023:039 Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence:

 24:023:040 And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.

 24:024:001 The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.

 24:024:002 One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.

 24:024:003 Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.

 24:024:004 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 24:024:005 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.

 24:024:006 For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.

 24:024:007 And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.

 24:024:008 And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:

 24:024:009 And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.

 24:024:010 And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.

 24:025:001 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;

 24:025:002 The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,

 24:025:003 From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.

 24:025:004 And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear.

 24:025:005 They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever:

 24:025:006 And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.

 24:025:007 Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.

 24:025:008 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard my words,

 24:025:009 Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.

 24:025:010 Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.

 24:025:011 And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.

 24:025:012 And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.

 24:025:013 And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.

 24:025:014 For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.

 24:025:015 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.

 24:025:016 And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.

 24:025:017 Then took I the cup at the LORD's hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me:

 24:025:018 To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day;

 24:025:019 Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;

 24:025:020 And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,

 24:025:021 Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,

 24:025:022 And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea,

 24:025:023 Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost corners,

 24:025:024 And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert,

 24:025:025 And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,

 24:025:026 And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.

 24:025:027 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.

 24:025:028 And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink.

 24:025:029 For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts.

 24:025:030 Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.

 24:025:031 A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the LORD.

 24:025:032 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.

 24:025:033 And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.

 24:025:034 Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.

 24:025:035 And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.

 24:025:036 A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the LORD hath spoiled their pasture.

 24:025:037 And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the LORD.

 24:025:038 He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.

 24:026:001 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,

 24:026:002 Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD's house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD's house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:

 24:026:003 If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.

 24:026:004 And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,

 24:026:005 To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;

 24:026:006 Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.

 24:026:007 So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.

 24:026:008 Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.

 24:026:009 Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.

 24:026:010 When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house.

 24:026:011 Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.

 24:026:012 Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.

 24:026:013 Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.

 24:026:014 As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you.

 24:026:015 But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.

 24:026:016 Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.

 24:026:017 Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,

 24:026:018 Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.

 24:026:019 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.

 24:026:020 And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.

 24:026:021 And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;

 24:026:022 And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.

 24:026:023 And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.

 24:026:024 Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.

 24:027:001 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

 24:027:002 Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck,

 24:027:003 And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;

 24:027:004 And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters;

 24:027:005 I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.

 24:027:006 And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.

 24:027:007 And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.

 24:027:008 And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.

 24:027:009 Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:

 24:027:010 For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.

 24:027:011 But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.

 24:027:012 I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.

 24:027:013 Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?

 24:027:014 Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.

 24:027:015 For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.

 24:027:016 Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD's house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.

 24:027:017 Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste?

 24:027:018 But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.

 24:027:019 For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city.

 24:027:020 Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;

 24:027:021 Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;

 24:027:022 They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.

 24:028:001 And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,

 24:028:002 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.

 24:028:003 Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon:

 24:028:004 And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.

 24:028:005 Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD,

 24:028:006 Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD's house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.

 24:028:007 Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people;

 24:028:008 The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.

 24:028:009 The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him.

 24:028:010 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it.

 24:028:011 And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.

 24:028:012 Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,

 24:028:013 Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.

 24:028:014 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.

 24:028:015 Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.

 24:028:016 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD.

 24:028:017 So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.

 24:029:001 Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;

 24:029:002 (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)

 24:029:003 By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,

 24:029:004 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;

 24:029:005 Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;

 24:029:006 Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished.

 24:029:007 And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.

 24:029:008 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.

 24:029:009 For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD.

 24:029:010 For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.

 24:029:011 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.

 24:029:012 Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.

 24:029:013 And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.

 24:029:014 And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.

 24:029:015 Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;

 24:029:016 Know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;

 24:029:017 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.

 24:029:018 And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them:

 24:029:019 Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.

 24:029:020 Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:

 24:029:021 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;

 24:029:022 And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;

 24:029:023 Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the LORD.

 24:029:024 Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,

 24:029:025 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,

 24:029:026 The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.

 24:029:027 Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?

 24:029:028 For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.

 24:029:029 And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.

 24:029:030 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

 24:029:031 Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:

 24:029:032 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.

 24:030:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

 24:030:002 Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.

 24:030:003 For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.

 24:030:004 And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.

 24:030:005 For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.

 24:030:006 Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?

 24:030:007 Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.

 24:030:008 For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:

 24:030:009 But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.

 24:030:010 Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.

 24:030:011 For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet I will not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.

 24:030:012 For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous.

 24:030:013 There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.

 24:030:014 All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.

 24:030:015 Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.

 24:030:016 Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.

 24:030:017 For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.

 24:030:018 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.

 24:030:019 And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.

 24:030:020 Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.

 24:030:021 And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.

 24:030:022 And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.

 24:030:023 Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.

 24:030:024 The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he hath done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.

 24:031:001 At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.

 24:031:002 Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.

 24:031:003 The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.

 24:031:004 Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.

 24:031:005 Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.

 24:031:006 For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God.

 24:031:007 For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.

 24:031:008 Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither.

 24:031:009 They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.

 24:031:010 Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.

 24:031:011 For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.

 24:031:012 Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.

 24:031:013 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.

 24:031:014 And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD.

 24:031:015 Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.

 24:031:016 Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.

 24:031:017 And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border.

 24:031:018 I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my God.

 24:031:019 Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.

 24:031:020 Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD.

 24:031:021 Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.

 24:031:022 How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.

 24:031:023 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.

 24:031:024 And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks.

 24:031:025 For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.

 24:031:026 Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.

 24:031:027 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.

 24:031:028 And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the LORD.

 24:031:029 In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.

 24:031:030 But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.

 24:031:031 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:

 24:031:032 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:

 24:031:033 But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.

 24:031:034 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.

 24:031:035 Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name:

 24:031:036 If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.

 24:031:037 Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.

 24:031:038 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.

 24:031:039 And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.

 24:031:040 And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.

 24:032:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.

 24:032:002 For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house.

 24:032:003 For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;

 24:032:004 And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;

 24:032:005 And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.

 24:032:006 And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 24:032:007 Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.

 24:032:008 So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.

 24:032:009 And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.

 24:032:010 And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.

 24:032:011 So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open:

 24:032:012 And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.

 24:032:013 And I charged Baruch before them, saying,

 24:032:014 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.

 24:032:015 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.

 24:032:016 Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,

 24:032:017 Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee:

 24:032:018 Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name,

 24:032:019 Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:

 24:032:020 Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day;

 24:032:021 And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;

 24:032:022 And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;

 24:032:023 And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:

 24:032:024 Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.

 24:032:025 And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.

 24:032:026 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

 24:032:027 Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?

 24:032:028 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:

 24:032:029 And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.

 24:032:030 For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD.

 24:032:031 For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,

 24:032:032 Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

 24:032:033 And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.

 24:032:034 But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.

 24:032:035 And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.

 24:032:036 And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;

 24:032:037 Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:

 24:032:038 And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:

 24:032:039 And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:

 24:032:040 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.

 24:032:041 Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.

 24:032:042 For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.

 24:032:043 And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.

 24:032:044 Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD.

 24:033:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,

 24:033:002 Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD is his name;

 24:033:003 Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.

 24:033:004 For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;

 24:033:005 They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.

 24:033:006 Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.

 24:033:007 And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.

 24:033:008 And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.

 24:033:009 And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.

 24:033:010 Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,

 24:033:011 The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD.

 24:033:012 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.

 24:033:013 In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them, saith the LORD.

 24:033:014 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.

 24:033:015 In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.

 24:033:016 In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our righteousness.

 24:033:017 For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;

 24:033:018 Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.

 24:033:019 And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,

 24:033:020 Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;

 24:033:021 Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.

 24:033:022 As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.

 24:033:023 Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,

 24:033:024 Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.

 24:033:025 Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;

 24:033:026 Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.

 24:034:001 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,

 24:034:002 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:

 24:034:003 And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.

 24:034:004 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:

 24:034:005 But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.

 24:034:006 Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,

 24:034:007 When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.

 24:034:008 This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;

 24:034:009 That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.

 24:034:010 Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.

 24:034:011 But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.

 24:034:012 Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

 24:034:013 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,

 24:034:014 At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.

 24:034:015 And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:

 24:034:016 But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.

 24:034:017 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.

 24:034:018 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,

 24:034:019 The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;

 24:034:020 I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.

 24:034:021 And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.

 24:034:022 Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.

 24:035:001 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,

 24:035:002 Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.

 24:035:003 Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;

 24:035:004 And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:

 24:035:005 And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.

 24:035:006 But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever:

 24:035:007 Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers.

 24:035:008 Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;

 24:035:009 Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:

 24:035:010 But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.

 24:035:011 But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.

 24:035:012 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

 24:035:013 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD.

 24:035:014 The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.

 24:035:015 I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.

 24:035:016 Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me:

 24:035:017 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.

 24:035:018 And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you:

 24:035:019 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.

 24:036:001 And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

 24:036:002 Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.

 24:036:003 It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.

 24:036:004 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.

 24:036:005 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD:

 24:036:006 Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD's house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.

 24:036:007 It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people.

 24:036:008 And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD's house.

 24:036:009 And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.

 24:036:010 Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.

 24:036:011 When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,

 24:036:012 Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.

 24:036:013 Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.

 24:036:014 Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.

 24:036:015 And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.

 24:036:016 Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.

 24:036:017 And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?

 24:036:018 Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.

 24:036:019 Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.

 24:036:020 And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.

 24:036:021 So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.

 24:036:022 Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.

 24:036:023 And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.

 24:036:024 Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.

 24:036:025 Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.

 24:036:026 But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.

 24:036:027 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,

 24:036:028 Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.

 24:036:029 And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?

 24:036:030 Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.

 24:036:031 And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.

 24:036:032 Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.

 24:037:001 And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.

 24:037:002 But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.

 24:037:003 And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.

 24:037:004 Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.

 24:037:005 Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.

 24:037:006 Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah saying,

 24:037:007 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.

 24:037:008 And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.

 24:037:009 Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.

 24:037:010 For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.

 24:037:011 And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,

 24:037:012 Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.

 24:037:013 And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.

 24:037:014 Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.

 24:037:015 Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.

 24:037:016 When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;

 24:037:017 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.

 24:037:018 Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?

 24:037:019 Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?

 24:037:020 Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.

 24:037:021 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

 24:038:001 Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,

 24:038:002 Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.

 24:038:003 Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.

 24:038:004 Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.

 24:038:005 Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.

 24:038:006 Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.

 24:038:007 Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;

 24:038:008 Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king saying,

 24:038:009 My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.

 24:038:010 Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.

 24:038:011 So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.

 24:038:012 And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.

 24:038:013 So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

 24:038:014 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.

 24:038:015 Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?

 24:038:016 So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.

 24:038:017 Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:

 24:038:018 But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.

 24:038:019 And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.

 24:038:020 But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.

 24:038:021 But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shewed me:

 24:038:022 And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.

 24:038:023 So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.

 24:038:024 Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.

 24:038:025 But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:

 24:038:026 Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.

 24:038:027 Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.

 24:038:028 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.

 24:039:001 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.

 24:039:002 And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.

 24:039:003 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.

 24:039:004 And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.

 24:039:005 But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.

 24:039:006 Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.

 24:039:007 Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.

 24:039:008 And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.

 24:039:009 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.

 24:039:010 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.

 24:039:011 Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,

 24:039:012 Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.

 24:039:013 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;

 24:039:014 Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.

 24:039:015 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,

 24:039:016 Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee.

 24:039:017 But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.

 24:039:018 For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.

 24:040:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon.

 24:040:002 And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.

 24:040:003 Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.

 24:040:004 And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.

 24:040:005 Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.

 24:040:006 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.

 24:040:007 Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;

 24:040:008 Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.

 24:040:009 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.

 24:040:010 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.

 24:040:011 Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;

 24:040:012 Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.

 24:040:013 Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,

 24:040:014 And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.

 24:040:015 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?

 24:040:016 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.

 24:041:001 Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.

 24:041:002 Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.

 24:041:003 Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war.

 24:041:004 And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,

 24:041:005 That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD.

 24:041:006 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.

 24:041:007 And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.

 24:041:008 But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.

 24:041:009 Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.

 24:041:010 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.

 24:041:011 But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,

 24:041:012 Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.

 24:041:013 Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad.

 24:041:014 So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.

 24:041:015 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.

 24:041:016 Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:

 24:041:017 And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,

 24:041:018 Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.

 24:042:001 Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,

 24:042:002 And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)

 24:042:003 That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do.

 24:042:004 Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.

 24:042:005 Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.

 24:042:006 Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.

 24:042:007 And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah.

 24:042:008 Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,

 24:042:009 And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;

 24:042:010 If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.

 24:042:011 Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.

 24:042:012 And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.

 24:042:013 But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,

 24:042:014 Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:

 24:042:015 And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;

 24:042:016 Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.

 24:042:017 So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.

 24:042:018 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.

 24:042:019 The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.

 24:042:020 For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it.

 24:042:021 And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you.

 24:042:022 Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn.

 24:043:001 And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words,

 24:043:002 Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:

 24:043:003 But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.

 24:043:004 So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah.

 24:043:005 But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;

 24:043:006 Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.

 24:043:007 So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.

 24:043:008 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,

 24:043:009 Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;

 24:043:010 And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.

 24:043:011 And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword.

 24:043:012 And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.

 24:043:013 He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.

 24:044:001 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,

 24:044:002 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,

 24:044:003 Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers.

 24:044:004 Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.

 24:044:005 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.

 24:044:006 Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.

 24:044:007 Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;

 24:044:008 In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?

 24:044:009 Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?

 24:044:010 They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.

 24:044:011 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.

 24:044:012 And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.

 24:044:013 For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:

 24:044:014 So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.

 24:044:015 Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,

 24:044:016 As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.

 24:044:017 But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.

 24:044:018 But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.

 24:044:019 And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?

 24:044:020 Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying,

 24:044:021 The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind?

 24:044:022 So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.

 24:044:023 Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.

 24:044:024 Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:

 24:044:025 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.

 24:044:026 Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.

 24:044:027 Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.

 24:044:028 Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or their's.

 24:044:029 And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:

 24:044:030 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.

 24:045:001 The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,

 24:045:002 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch:

 24:045:003 Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.

 24:045:004 Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land.

 24:045:005 And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.

 24:046:001 The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles;

 24:046:002 Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.

 24:046:003 Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.

 24:046:004 Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines.

 24:046:005 Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: for fear was round about, saith the LORD.

 24:046:006 Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.

 24:046:007 Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?

 24:046:008 Egypt riseth up like a flood, and his waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.

 24:046:009 Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.

 24:046:010 For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.

 24:046:011 Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt not be cured.

 24:046:012 The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, and they are fallen both together.

 24:046:013 The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt.

 24:046:014 Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour round about thee.

 24:046:015 Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them.

 24:046:016 He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.

 24:046:017 They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath passed the time appointed.

 24:046:018 As I live, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.

 24:046:019 O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.

 24:046:020 Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north.

 24:046:021 Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and the time of their visitation.

 24:046:022 The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.

 24:046:023 They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.

 24:046:024 The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.

 24:046:025 The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him:

 24:046:026 And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the LORD.

 24:046:027 But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.

 24:046:028 Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I am with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee: but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure; yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished.

 24:047:001 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.

 24:047:002 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.

 24:047:003 At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands;

 24:047:004 Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.

 24:047:005 Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?

 24:047:006 O thou sword of the LORD, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.

 24:047:007 How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it.

 24:048:001 Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded and taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.

 24:048:002 There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.

 24:048:003 A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.

 24:048:004 Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.

 24:048:005 For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.

 24:048:006 Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.

 24:048:007 For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together.

 24:048:008 And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.

 24:048:009 Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.

 24:048:010 Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.

 24:048:011 Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.

 24:048:012 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.

 24:048:013 And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.

 24:048:014 How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war?

 24:048:015 Moab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.

 24:048:016 The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.

 24:048:017 All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, and the beautiful rod!

 24:048:018 Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, and he shall destroy thy strong holds.

 24:048:019 O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, and say, What is done?

 24:048:020 Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,

 24:048:021 And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,

 24:048:022 And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim,

 24:048:023 And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon,

 24:048:024 And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.

 24:048:025 The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.

 24:048:026 Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.

 24:048:027 For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.

 24:048:028 O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.

 24:048:029 We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.

 24:048:030 I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it shall not be so; his lies shall not so effect it.

 24:048:031 Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.

 24:048:032 O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.

 24:048:033 And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.

 24:048:034 From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.

 24:048:035 Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.

 24:048:036 Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches that he hath gotten are perished.

 24:048:037 For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.

 24:048:038 There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD.

 24:048:039 They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.

 24:048:040 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.

 24:048:041 Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.

 24:048:042 And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against the LORD.

 24:048:043 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.

 24:048:044 He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.

 24:048:045 They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.

 24:048:046 Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.

 24:048:047 Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.

 24:049:001 Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?

 24:049:002 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.

 24:049:003 Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.

 24:049:004 Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me?

 24:049:005 Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.

 24:049:006 And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.

 24:049:007 Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?

 24:049:008 Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit him.

 24:049:009 If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.

 24:049:010 But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.

 24:049:011 Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.

 24:049:012 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it.

 24:049:013 For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.

 24:049:014 I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.

 24:049:015 For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised among men.

 24:049:016 Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.

 24:049:017 Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.

 24:049:018 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.

 24:049:019 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?

 24:049:020 Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.

 24:049:021 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.

 24:049:022 Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.

 24:049:023 Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.

 24:049:024 Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.

 24:049:025 How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!

 24:049:026 Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.

 24:049:027 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.

 24:049:028 Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.

 24:049:029 Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side.

 24:049:030 Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.

 24:049:031 Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone.

 24:049:032 And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.

 24:049:033 And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.

 24:049:034 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,

 24:049:035 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.

 24:049:036 And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.

 24:049:037 For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:

 24:049:038 And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD.

 24:049:039 But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.

 24:050:001 The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.

 24:050:002 Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.

 24:050:003 For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.

 24:050:004 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.

 24:050:005 They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.

 24:050:006 My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.

 24:050:007 All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.

 24:050:008 Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.

 24:050:009 For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.

 24:050:010 And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.

 24:050:011 Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;

 24:050:012 Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.

 24:050:013 Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.

 24:050:014 Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD.

 24:050:015 Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.

 24:050:016 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.

 24:050:017 Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.

 24:050:018 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.

 24:050:019 And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.

 24:050:020 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.

 24:050:021 Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.

 24:050:022 A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.

 24:050:023 How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!

 24:050:024 I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.

 24:050:025 The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.

 24:050:026 Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.

 24:050:027 Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.

 24:050:028 The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.

 24:050:029 Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.

 24:050:030 Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.

 24:050:031 Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.

 24:050:032 And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.

 24:050:033 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.

 24:050:034 Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.

 24:050:035 A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.

 24:050:036 A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.

 24:050:037 A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.

 24:050:038 A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.

 24:050:039 Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.

 24:050:040 As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.

 24:050:041 Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.

 24:050:042 They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.

 24:050:043 The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.

 24:050:044 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?

 24:050:045 Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.

 24:050:046 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.

 24:051:001 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind;

 24:051:002 And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.

 24:051:003 Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.

 24:051:004 Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets.

 24:051:005 For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.

 24:051:006 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.

 24:051:007 Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.

 24:051:008 Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.

 24:051:009 We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.

 24:051:010 The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.

 24:051:011 Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.

 24:051:012 Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon.

 24:051:013 O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.

 24:051:014 The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout against thee.

 24:051:015 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding.

 24:051:016 When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.

 24:051:017 Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.

 24:051:018 They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.

 24:051:019 The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name.

 24:051:020 Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;

 24:051:021 And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;

 24:051:022 With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;

 24:051:023 I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.

 24:051:024 And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD.

 24:051:025 Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.

 24:051:026 And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD.

 24:051:027 Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.

 24:051:028 Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion.

 24:051:029 And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.

 24:051:030 The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.

 24:051:031 One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end,

 24:051:032 And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.

 24:051:033 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.

 24:051:034 Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out.

 24:051:035 The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.

 24:051:036 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.

 24:051:037 And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.

 24:051:038 They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions' whelps.

 24:051:039 In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD.

 24:051:040 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.

 24:051:041 How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!

 24:051:042 The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.

 24:051:043 Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby.

 24:051:044 And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.

 24:051:045 My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.

 24:051:046 And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.

 24:051:047 Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.

 24:051:048 Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the LORD.

 24:051:049 As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.

 24:051:050 Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.

 24:051:051 We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD's house.

 24:051:052 Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.

 24:051:053 Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD.

 24:051:054 A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:

 24:051:055 Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:

 24:051:056 Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.

 24:051:057 And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.

 24:051:058 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.

 24:051:059 The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.

 24:051:060 So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.

 24:051:061 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;

 24:051:062 Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.

 24:051:063 And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:

 24:051:064 And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.

 24:052:001 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

 24:052:002 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

 24:052:003 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

 24:052:004 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about.

 24:052:005 So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.

 24:052:006 And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.

 24:052:007 Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.

 24:052:008 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.

 24:052:009 Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.

 24:052:010 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.

 24:052:011 Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.

 24:052:012 Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,

 24:052:013 And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with fire:

 24:052:014 And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.

 24:052:015 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.

 24:052:016 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.

 24:052:017 Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.

 24:052:018 The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.

 24:052:019 And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away.

 24:052:020 The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.

 24:052:021 And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.

 24:052:022 And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these.

 24:052:023 And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.

 24:052:024 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:

 24:052:025 He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.

 24:052:026 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.

 24:052:027 And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.

 24:052:028 This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:

 24:052:029 In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:

 24:052:030 In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.

 24:052:031 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison.

 24:052:032 And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,

 24:052:033 And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life.

 24:052:034 And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.

 Book 25 Lamentations

 25:001:001 How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!

 25:001:002 She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.

 25:001:003 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.

 25:001:004 The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.

 25:001:005 Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.

 25:001:006 And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.

 25:001:007 Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.

 25:001:008 Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.

 25:001:009 Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.

 25:001:010 The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.

 25:001:011 All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile.

 25:001:012 Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.

 25:001:013 From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.

 25:001:014 The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the LORD hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up.

 25:001:015 The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the LORD hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.

 25:001:016 For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.

 25:001:017 Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.

 25:001:018 The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.

 25:001:019 I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.

 25:001:020 Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.

 25:001:021 They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.

 25:001:022 Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.

 25:002:001 How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!

 25:002:002 The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.

 25:002:003 He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.

 25:002:004 He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.

 25:002:005 The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.

 25:002:006 And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.

 25:002:007 The LORD hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.

 25:002:008 The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.

 25:002:009 Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.

 25:002:010 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.

 25:002:011 Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.

 25:002:012 They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.

 25:002:013 What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?

 25:002:014 Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.

 25:002:015 All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?

 25:002:016 All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.

 25:002:017 The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.

 25:002:018 Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.

 25:002:019 Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the LORD: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.

 25:002:020 Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?

 25:002:021 The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied.

 25:002:022 Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.

 25:003:001 I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.

 25:003:002 He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.

 25:003:003 Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day.

 25:003:004 My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.

 25:003:005 He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.

 25:003:006 He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.

 25:003:007 He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.

 25:003:008 Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.

 25:003:009 He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.

 25:003:010 He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.

 25:003:011 He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.

 25:003:012 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.

 25:003:013 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.

 25:003:014 I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.

 25:003:015 He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.

 25:003:016 He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.

 25:003:017 And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.

 25:003:018 And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:

 25:003:019 Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.

 25:003:020 My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.

 25:003:021 This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.

 25:003:022 It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.

 25:003:023 They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.

 25:003:024 The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.

 25:003:025 The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.

 25:003:026 It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.

 25:003:027 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth.

 25:003:028 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.

 25:003:029 He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.

 25:003:030 He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.

 25:003:031 For the LORD will not cast off for ever:

 25:003:032 But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.

 25:003:033 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.

 25:003:034 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth.

 25:003:035 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,

 25:003:036 To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not.

 25:003:037 Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?

 25:003:038 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?

 25:003:039 Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?

 25:003:040 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.

 25:003:041 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.

 25:003:042 We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.

 25:003:043 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.

 25:003:044 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through.

 25:003:045 Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.

 25:003:046 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.

 25:003:047 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.

 25:003:048 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.

 25:003:049 Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission.

 25:003:050 Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.

 25:003:051 Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.

 25:003:052 Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.

 25:003:053 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.

 25:003:054 Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.

 25:003:055 I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.

 25:003:056 Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.

 25:003:057 Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.

 25:003:058 O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.

 25:003:059 O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.

 25:003:060 Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.

 25:003:061 Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me;

 25:003:062 The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.

 25:003:063 Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick.

 25:003:064 Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.

 25:003:065 Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.

 25:003:066 Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.

 25:004:001 How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.

 25:004:002 The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!

 25:004:003 Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.

 25:004:004 The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.

 25:004:005 They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.

 25:004:006 For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.

 25:004:007 Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire:

 25:004:008 Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.

 25:004:009 They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field.

 25:004:010 The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.

 25:004:011 The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.

 25:004:012 The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.

 25:004:013 For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,

 25:004:014 They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.

 25:004:015 They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.

 25:004:016 The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.

 25:004:017 As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.

 25:004:018 They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.

 25:004:019 Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.

 25:004:020 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.

 25:004:021 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.

 25:004:022 The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.

 25:005:001 Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach.

 25:005:002 Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.

 25:005:003 We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.

 25:005:004 We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.

 25:005:005 Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.

 25:005:006 We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.

 25:005:007 Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities.

 25:005:008 Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand.

 25:005:009 We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.

 25:005:010 Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.

 25:005:011 They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of Judah.

 25:005:012 Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.

 25:005:013 They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.

 25:005:014 The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick.

 25:005:015 The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.

 25:005:016 The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!

 25:005:017 For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim.

 25:005:018 Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.

 25:005:019 Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.

 25:005:020 Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time?

 25:005:021 Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.

 25:005:022 But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.

 Book 26 Ezekiel

 26:001:001 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.

 26:001:002 In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,

 26:001:003 The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.

 26:001:004 And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.

 26:001:005 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.

 26:001:006 And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.

 26:001:007 And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.

 26:001:008 And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.

 26:001:009 Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.

 26:001:010 As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.

 26:001:011 Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.

 26:001:012 And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.

 26:001:013 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.

 26:001:014 And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.

 26:001:015 Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.

 26:001:016 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.

 26:001:017 When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.

 26:001:018 As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.

 26:001:019 And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.

 26:001:020 Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.

 26:001:021 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.

 26:001:022 And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.

 26:001:023 And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.

 26:001:024 And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.

 26:001:025 And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.

 26:001:026 And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.

 26:001:027 And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.

 26:001:028 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.

 26:002:001 And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.

 26:002:002 And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.

 26:002:003 And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.

 26:002:004 For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.

 26:002:005 And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.

 26:002:006 And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.

 26:002:007 And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.

 26:002:008 But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.

 26:002:009 And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;

 26:002:010 And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.

 26:003:001 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.

 26:003:002 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.

 26:003:003 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.

 26:003:004 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.

 26:003:005 For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;

 26:003:006 Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.

 26:003:007 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.

 26:003:008 Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.

 26:003:009 As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.

 26:003:010 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.

 26:003:011 And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.

 26:003:012 Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.

 26:003:013 I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.

 26:003:014 So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.

 26:003:015 Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.

 26:003:016 And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:003:017 Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.

 26:003:018 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.

 26:003:019 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.

 26:003:020 Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.

 26:003:021 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.

 26:003:022 And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.

 26:003:023 Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.

 26:003:024 Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.

 26:003:025 But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:

 26:003:026 And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.

 26:003:027 But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.

 26:004:001 Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, even Jerusalem:

 26:004:002 And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about.

 26:004:003 Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.

 26:004:004 Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.

 26:004:005 For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.

 26:004:006 And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.

 26:004:007 Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.

 26:004:008 And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.

 26:004:009 Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.

 26:004:010 And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.

 26:004:011 Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.

 26:004:012 And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.

 26:004:013 And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.

 26:004:014 Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.

 26:004:015 Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.

 26:004:016 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:

 26:004:017 That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.

 26:005:001 And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's razor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.

 26:005:002 Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, and smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.

 26:005:003 Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.

 26:005:004 Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.

 26:005:005 Thus saith the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her.

 26:005:006 And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.

 26:005:007 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you;

 26:005:008 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.

 26:005:009 And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.

 26:005:010 Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.

 26:005:011 Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.

 26:005:012 A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.

 26:005:013 Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.

 26:005:014 Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.

 26:005:015 So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken it.

 26:005:016 When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:

 26:005:017 So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee: and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken it.

 26:006:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:006:002 Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,

 26:006:003 And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.

 26:006:004 And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.

 26:006:005 And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.

 26:006:006 In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.

 26:006:007 And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:006:008 Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.

 26:006:009 And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.

 26:006:010 And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.

 26:006:011 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.

 26:006:012 He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.

 26:006:013 Then shall ye know that I am the LORD, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols.

 26:006:014 So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:007:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:007:002 Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.

 26:007:003 Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.

 26:007:004 And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:007:005 Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.

 26:007:006 An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.

 26:007:007 The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.

 26:007:008 Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.

 26:007:009 And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth.

 26:007:010 Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.

 26:007:011 Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of their's: neither shall there be wailing for them.

 26:007:012 The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.

 26:007:013 For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.

 26:007:014 They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.

 26:007:015 The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.

 26:007:016 But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.

 26:007:017 All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.

 26:007:018 They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.

 26:007:019 They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.

 26:007:020 As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.

 26:007:021 And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.

 26:007:022 My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.

 26:007:023 Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.

 26:007:024 Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.

 26:007:025 Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.

 26:007:026 Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.

 26:007:027 The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:008:001 And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.

 26:008:002 Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.

 26:008:003 And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.

 26:008:004 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.

 26:008:005 Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.

 26:008:006 He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations.

 26:008:007 And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.

 26:008:008 Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.

 26:008:009 And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.

 26:008:010 So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about.

 26:008:011 And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.

 26:008:012 Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, the LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth.

 26:008:013 He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do.

 26:008:014 Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.

 26:008:015 Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.

 26:008:016 And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.

 26:008:017 Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.

 26:008:018 Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.

 26:009:001 He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.

 26:009:002 And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar.

 26:009:003 And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side;

 26:009:004 And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.

 26:009:005 And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:

 26:009:006 Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.

 26:009:007 And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.

 26:009:008 And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?

 26:009:009 Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.

 26:009:010 And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head.

 26:009:011 And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.

 26:010:001 Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.

 26:010:002 And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.

 26:010:003 Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.

 26:010:004 Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD's glory.

 26:010:005 And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.

 26:010:006 And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.

 26:010:007 And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.

 26:010:008 And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings.

 26:010:009 And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.

 26:010:010 And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.

 26:010:011 When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.

 26:010:012 And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.

 26:010:013 As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.

 26:010:014 And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.

 26:010:015 And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.

 26:010:016 And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.

 26:010:017 When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.

 26:010:018 Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims.

 26:010:019 And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.

 26:010:020 This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims.

 26:010:021 Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.

 26:010:022 And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.

 26:011:001 Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the LORD's house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.

 26:011:002 Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:

 26:011:003 Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the flesh.

 26:011:004 Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.

 26:011:005 And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.

 26:011:006 Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.

 26:011:007 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.

 26:011:008 Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:011:009 And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.

 26:011:010 Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:011:011 This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border of Israel:

 26:011:012 And ye shall know that I am the LORD: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you.

 26:011:013 And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?

 26:011:014 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:011:015 Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.

 26:011:016 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.

 26:011:017 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.

 26:011:018 And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.

 26:011:019 And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:

 26:011:020 That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.

 26:011:021 But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:011:022 Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.

 26:011:023 And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.

 26:011:024 Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.

 26:011:025 Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me.

 26:012:001 The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying,

 26:012:002 Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.

 26:012:003 Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house.

 26:012:004 Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.

 26:012:005 Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.

 26:012:006 In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.

 26:012:007 And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.

 26:012:008 And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,

 26:012:009 Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?

 26:012:010 Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them.

 26:012:011 Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove and go into captivity.

 26:012:012 And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.

 26:012:013 My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.

 26:012:014 And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.

 26:012:015 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.

 26:012:016 But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:012:017 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

 26:012:018 Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness;

 26:012:019 And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.

 26:012:020 And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:012:021 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:012:022 Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?

 26:012:023 Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.

 26:012:024 For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.

 26:012:025 For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:012:026 Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying.

 26:012:027 Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far off.

 26:012:028 Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:013:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:013:002 Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the LORD;

 26:013:003 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!

 26:013:004 O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.

 26:013:005 Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.

 26:013:006 They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word.

 26:013:007 Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have not spoken?

 26:013:008 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:013:009 And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

 26:013:010 Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered morter:

 26:013:011 Say unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.

 26:013:012 Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?

 26:013:013 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.

 26:013:014 So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:013:015 Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered morter, and will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;

 26:013:016 To wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:013:017 Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,

 26:013:018 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you?

 26:013:019 And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?

 26:013:020 Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly.

 26:013:021 Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:013:022 Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:

 26:013:023 Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:014:001 Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.

 26:014:002 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:014:003 Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them?

 26:014:004 Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;

 26:014:005 That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.

 26:014:006 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.

 26:014:007 For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:

 26:014:008 And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:014:009 And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.

 26:014:010 And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him;

 26:014:011 That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:014:012 The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,

 26:014:013 Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:

 26:014:014 Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:014:015 If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:

 26:014:016 Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.

 26:014:017 Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:

 26:014:018 Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.

 26:014:019 Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:

 26:014:020 Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.

 26:014:021 For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?

 26:014:022 Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.

 26:014:023 And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:015:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:015:002 Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest?

 26:015:003 Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?

 26:015:004 Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?

 26:015:005 Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?

 26:015:006 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

 26:015:007 And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.

 26:015:008 And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:016:001 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:016:002 Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,

 26:016:003 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.

 26:016:004 And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.

 26:016:005 None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.

 26:016:006 And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live.

 26:016:007 I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou wast naked and bare.

 26:016:008 Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine.

 26:016:009 Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.

 26:016:010 I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.

 26:016:011 I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.

 26:016:012 And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.

 26:016:013 Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.

 26:016:014 And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:016:015 But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.

 26:016:016 And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.

 26:016:017 Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,

 26:016:018 And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.

 26:016:019 My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:016:020 Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter,

 26:016:021 That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?

 26:016:022 And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.

 26:016:023 And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the LORD GOD;)

 26:016:024 That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.

 26:016:025 Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.

 26:016:026 Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.

 26:016:027 Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.

 26:016:028 Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.

 26:016:029 Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied therewith.

 26:016:030 How weak is thine heart, saith the LORD GOD, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;

 26:016:031 In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;

 26:016:032 But as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband!

 26:016:033 They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.

 26:016:034 And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.

 26:016:035 Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:

 26:016:036 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;

 26:016:037 Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.

 26:016:038 And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.

 26:016:039 And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.

 26:016:040 They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.

 26:016:041 And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.

 26:016:042 So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.

 26:016:043 Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.

 26:016:044 Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.

 26:016:045 Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.

 26:016:046 And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.

 26:016:047 Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.

 26:016:048 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.

 26:016:049 Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.

 26:016:050 And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.

 26:016:051 Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.

 26:016:052 Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.

 26:016:053 When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:

 26:016:054 That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.

 26:016:055 When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.

 26:016:056 For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,

 26:016:057 Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.

 26:016:058 Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.

 26:016:059 For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.

 26:016:060 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.

 26:016:061 Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.

 26:016:062 And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD:

 26:016:063 That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:017:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:017:002 Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;

 26:017:003 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:

 26:017:004 He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.

 26:017:005 He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree.

 26:017:006 And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.

 26:017:007 There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.

 26:017:008 It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.

 26:017:009 Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.

 26:017:010 Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.

 26:017:011 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:017:012 Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;

 26:017:013 And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:

 26:017:014 That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.

 26:017:015 But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?

 26:017:016 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.

 26:017:017 Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:

 26:017:018 Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape.

 26:017:019 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.

 26:017:020 And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.

 26:017:021 And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.

 26:017:022 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent:

 26:017:023 In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.

 26:017:024 And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.

 26:018:001 The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,

 26:018:002 What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?

 26:018:003 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.

 26:018:004 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.

 26:018:005 But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,

 26:018:006 And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman,

 26:018:007 And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;

 26:018:008 He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man,

 26:018:009 Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:018:010 If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth the like to any one of these things,

 26:018:011 And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,

 26:018:012 Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,

 26:018:013 Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.

 26:018:014 Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,

 26:018:015 That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour's wife,

 26:018:016 Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment,

 26:018:017 That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.

 26:018:018 As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.

 26:018:019 Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.

 26:018:020 The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.

 26:018:021 But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.

 26:018:022 All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.

 26:018:023 Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?

 26:018:024 But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.

 26:018:025 Yet ye say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?

 26:018:026 When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.

 26:018:027 Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.

 26:018:028 Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.

 26:018:029 Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the LORD is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?

 26:018:030 Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.

 26:018:031 Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?

 26:018:032 For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.

 26:019:001 Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,

 26:019:002 And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.

 26:019:003 And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.

 26:019:004 The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.

 26:019:005 Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.

 26:019:006 And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.

 26:019:007 And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of his roaring.

 26:019:008 Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.

 26:019:009 And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.

 26:019:010 Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.

 26:019:011 And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.

 26:019:012 But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.

 26:019:013 And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground.

 26:019:014 And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.

 26:020:001 And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the LORD, and sat before me.

 26:020:002 Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,

 26:020:003 Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.

 26:020:004 Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:

 26:020:005 And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the LORD your God;

 26:020:006 In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:

 26:020:007 Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

 26:020:008 But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.

 26:020:009 But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.

 26:020:010 Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.

 26:020:011 And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.

 26:020:012 Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.

 26:020:013 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.

 26:020:014 But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.

 26:020:015 Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;

 26:020:016 Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.

 26:020:017 Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.

 26:020:018 But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:

 26:020:019 I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;

 26:020:020 And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.

 26:020:021 Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.

 26:020:022 Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.

 26:020:023 I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;

 26:020:024 Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.

 26:020:025 Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;

 26:020:026 And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD.

 26:020:027 Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.

 26:020:028 For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.

 26:020:029 Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go? And the name whereof is called Bamah unto this day.

 26:020:030 Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations?

 26:020:031 For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.

 26:020:032 And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.

 26:020:033 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:

 26:020:034 And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.

 26:020:035 And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.

 26:020:036 Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:020:037 And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:

 26:020:038 And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:020:039 As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.

 26:020:040 For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.

 26:020:041 I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.

 26:020:042 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers.

 26:020:043 And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.

 26:020:044 And ye shall know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:020:045 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:020:046 Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;

 26:020:047 And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.

 26:020:048 And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.

 26:020:049 Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak parables?

 26:021:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:021:002 Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,

 26:021:003 And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.

 26:021:004 Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:

 26:021:005 That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.

 26:021:006 Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.

 26:021:007 And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:021:008 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:021:009 Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:

 26:021:010 It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree.

 26:021:011 And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.

 26:021:012 Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh.

 26:021:013 Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the rod? it shall be no more, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:021:014 Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.

 26:021:015 I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.

 26:021:016 Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, whithersoever thy face is set.

 26:021:017 I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said it.

 26:021:018 The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,

 26:021:019 Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.

 26:021:020 Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.

 26:021:021 For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.

 26:021:022 At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.

 26:021:023 And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.

 26:021:024 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.

 26:021:025 And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end,

 26:021:026 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high.

 26:021:027 I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.

 26:021:028 And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the glittering:

 26:021:029 Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have an end.

 26:021:030 Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.

 26:021:031 And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy.

 26:021:032 Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the LORD have spoken it.

 26:022:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:022:002 Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.

 26:022:003 Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.

 26:022:004 Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.

 26:022:005 Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed.

 26:022:006 Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.

 26:022:007 In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.

 26:022:008 Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.

 26:022:009 In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.

 26:022:010 In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.

 26:022:011 And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.

 26:022:012 In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:022:013 Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.

 26:022:014 Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.

 26:022:015 And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.

 26:022:016 And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

 26:022:017 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:022:018 Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.

 26:022:019 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.

 26:022:020 As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.

 26:022:021 Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst therof.

 26:022:022 As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.

 26:022:023 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:022:024 Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.

 26:022:025 There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.

 26:022:026 Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.

 26:022:027 Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.

 26:022:028 And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.

 26:022:029 The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.

 26:022:030 And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.

 26:022:031 Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:023:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

 26:023:002 Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:

 26:023:003 And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.

 26:023:004 And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.

 26:023:005 And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,

 26:023:006 Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.

 26:023:007 Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.

 26:023:008 Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.

 26:023:009 Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.

 26:023:010 These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.

 26:023:011 And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.

 26:023:012 She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.

 26:023:013 Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,

 26:023:014 And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,

 26:023:015 Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:

 26:023:016 And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.

 26:023:017 And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.

 26:023:018 So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.

 26:023:019 Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.

 26:023:020 For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

 26:023:021 Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.

 26:023:022 Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;

 26:023:023 The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.

 26:023:024 And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.

 26:023:025 And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.

 26:023:026 They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.

 26:023:027 Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.

 26:023:028 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated:

 26:023:029 And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.

 26:023:030 I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.

 26:023:031 Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.

 26:023:032 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.

 26:023:033 Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.

 26:023:034 Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:023:035 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.

 26:023:036 The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;

 26:023:037 That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.

 26:023:038 Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.

 26:023:039 For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.

 26:023:040 And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,

 26:023:041 And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.

 26:023:042 And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.

 26:023:043 Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?

 26:023:044 Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.

 26:023:045 And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.

 26:023:046 For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.

 26:023:047 And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.

 26:023:048 Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.

 26:023:049 And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

 26:024:001 Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:024:002 Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.

 26:024:003 And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:

 26:024:004 Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.

 26:024:005 Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.

 26:024:006 Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.

 26:024:007 For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;

 26:024:008 That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.

 26:024:009 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.

 26:024:010 Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.

 26:024:011 Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.

 26:024:012 She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.

 26:024:013 In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.

 26:024:014 I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:024:015 Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:024:016 Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.

 26:024:017 Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.

 26:024:018 So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.

 26:024:019 And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?

 26:024:020 Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:024:021 Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.

 26:024:022 And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.

 26:024:023 And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.

 26:024:024 Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

 26:024:025 Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,

 26:024:026 That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?

 26:024:027 In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:025:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

 26:025:002 Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;

 26:025:003 And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;

 26:025:004 Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.

 26:025:005 And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couching place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:025:006 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel;

 26:025:007 Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

 26:025:008 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen;

 26:025:009 Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,

 26:025:010 Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.

 26:025:011 And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:025:012 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;

 26:025:013 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.

 26:025:014 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:025:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old hatred;

 26:025:016 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.

 26:025:017 And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.

 26:026:001 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:026:002 Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste:

 26:026:003 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up.

 26:026:004 And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.

 26:026:005 It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD: and it shall become a spoil to the nations.

 26:026:006 And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:026:007 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.

 26:026:008 He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee.

 26:026:009 And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.

 26:026:010 By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.

 26:026:011 With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.

 26:026:012 And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.

 26:026:013 And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.

 26:026:014 And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:026:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?

 26:026:016 Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at thee.

 26:026:017 And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it!

 26:026:018 Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.

 26:026:019 For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee;

 26:026:020 When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living;

 26:026:021 I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more: though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:027:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

 26:027:002 Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;

 26:027:003 And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, which art a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I am of perfect beauty.

 26:027:004 Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty.

 26:027:005 They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.

 26:027:006 Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out of the isles of Chittim.

 26:027:007 Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee.

 26:027:008 The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise men, O Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots.

 26:027:009 The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise.

 26:027:010 They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.

 26:027:011 The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect.

 26:027:012 Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.

 26:027:013 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.

 26:027:014 They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.

 26:027:015 The men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles were the merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee for a present horns of ivory and ebony.

 26:027:016 Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.

 26:027:017 Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.

 26:027:018 Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.

 26:027:019 Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.

 26:027:020 Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.

 26:027:021 Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they thy merchants.

 26:027:022 The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants: they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.

 26:027:023 Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad, were thy merchants.

 26:027:024 These were thy merchants in all sorts of things, in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.

 26:027:025 The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.

 26:027:026 Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.

 26:027:027 Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, and in all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.

 26:027:028 The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.

 26:027:029 And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;

 26:027:030 And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:

 26:027:031 And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing.

 26:027:032 And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, saying, What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?

 26:027:033 When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.

 26:027:034 In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall.

 26:027:035 All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in their countenance.

 26:027:036 The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt be any more.

 26:028:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

 26:028:002 Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God:

 26:028:003 Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee:

 26:028:004 With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures:

 26:028:005 By thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches:

 26:028:006 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God;

 26:028:007 Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.

 26:028:008 They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas.

 26:028:009 Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.

 26:028:010 Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:028:011 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:028:012 Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.

 26:028:013 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.

 26:028:014 Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

 26:028:015 Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.

 26:028:016 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.

 26:028:017 Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.

 26:028:018 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.

 26:028:019 All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.

 26:028:020 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:028:021 Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it,

 26:028:022 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.

 26:028:023 For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:028:024 And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

 26:028:025 Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.

 26:028:026 And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God.

 26:029:001 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:029:002 Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:

 26:029:003 Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.

 26:029:004 But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.

 26:029:005 And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.

 26:029:006 And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.

 26:029:007 When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.

 26:029:008 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.

 26:029:009 And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am the LORD: because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it.

 26:029:010 Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.

 26:029:011 No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.

 26:029:012 And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.

 26:029:013 Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:

 26:029:014 And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.

 26:029:015 It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.

 26:029:016 And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

 26:029:017 And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:029:018 Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it:

 26:029:019 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.

 26:029:020 I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:029:021 In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:030:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

 26:030:002 Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Howl ye, Woe worth the day!

 26:030:003 For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a cloudy day; it shall be the time of the heathen.

 26:030:004 And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.

 26:030:005 Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.

 26:030:006 Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:030:007 And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.

 26:030:008 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and when all her helpers shall be destroyed.

 26:030:009 In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh.

 26:030:010 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.

 26:030:011 He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.

 26:030:012 And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the LORD have spoken it.

 26:030:013 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause their images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.

 26:030:014 And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments in No.

 26:030:015 And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.

 26:030:016 And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be rent asunder, and Noph shall have distresses daily.

 26:030:017 The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword: and these cities shall go into captivity.

 26:030:018 At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.

 26:030:019 Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:030:020 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:030:021 Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword.

 26:030:022 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.

 26:030:023 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.

 26:030:024 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.

 26:030:025 But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.

 26:030:026 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:031:001 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:031:002 Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?

 26:031:003 Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.

 26:031:004 The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.

 26:031:005 Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.

 26:031:006 All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.

 26:031:007 Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.

 26:031:008 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.

 26:031:009 I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.

 26:031:010 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;

 26:031:011 I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.

 26:031:012 And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.

 26:031:013 Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:

 26:031:014 To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.

 26:031:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.

 26:031:016 I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.

 26:031:017 They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen.

 26:031:018 To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:032:001 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:032:002 Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.

 26:032:003 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net.

 26:032:004 Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.

 26:032:005 And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.

 26:032:006 I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.

 26:032:007 And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.

 26:032:008 All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:032:009 I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.

 26:032:010 Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.

 26:032:011 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.

 26:032:012 By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.

 26:032:013 I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.

 26:032:014 Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:032:015 When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the LORD.

 26:032:016 This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:032:017 It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:032:018 Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.

 26:032:019 Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.

 26:032:020 They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her multitudes.

 26:032:021 The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.

 26:032:022 Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him: all of them slain, fallen by the sword:

 26:032:023 Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.

 26:032:024 There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.

 26:032:025 They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that be slain.

 26:032:026 There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.

 26:032:027 And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.

 26:032:028 Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword.

 26:032:029 There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.

 26:032:030 There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit.

 26:032:031 Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:032:032 For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:033:001 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:033:002 Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:

 26:033:003 If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;

 26:033:004 Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.

 26:033:005 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.

 26:033:006 But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.

 26:033:007 So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.

 26:033:008 When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.

 26:033:009 Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.

 26:033:010 Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?

 26:033:011 Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?

 26:033:012 Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth.

 26:033:013 When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.

 26:033:014 Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;

 26:033:015 If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.

 26:033:016 None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.

 26:033:017 Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.

 26:033:018 When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.

 26:033:019 But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.

 26:033:020 Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.

 26:033:021 And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.

 26:033:022 Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.

 26:033:023 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:033:024 Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.

 26:033:025 Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?

 26:033:026 Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land?

 26:033:027 Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.

 26:033:028 For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.

 26:033:029 Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.

 26:033:030 Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD.

 26:033:031 And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness.

 26:033:032 And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not.

 26:033:033 And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.

 26:034:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:034:002 Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?

 26:034:003 Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.

 26:034:004 The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.

 26:034:005 And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.

 26:034:006 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them.

 26:034:007 Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;

 26:034:008 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;

 26:034:009 Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;

 26:034:010 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.

 26:034:011 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.

 26:034:012 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.

 26:034:013 And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.

 26:034:014 I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.

 26:034:015 I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:034:016 I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.

 26:034:017 And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.

 26:034:018 Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?

 26:034:019 And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.

 26:034:020 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.

 26:034:021 Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;

 26:034:022 Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.

 26:034:023 And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.

 26:034:024 And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it.

 26:034:025 And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.

 26:034:026 And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.

 26:034:027 And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.

 26:034:028 And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.

 26:034:029 And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.

 26:034:030 Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:034:031 And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:035:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:035:002 Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,

 26:035:003 And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I am against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.

 26:035:004 I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

 26:035:005 Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end:

 26:035:006 Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.

 26:035:007 Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.

 26:035:008 And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.

 26:035:009 I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:035:010 Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there:

 26:035:011 Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.

 26:035:012 And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.

 26:035:013 Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.

 26:035:014 Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.

 26:035:015 As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:036:001 Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD:

 26:036:002 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession:

 26:036:003 Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are an infamy of the people:

 26:036:004 Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about;

 26:036:005 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey.

 26:036:006 Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen:

 26:036:007 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their shame.

 26:036:008 But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come.

 26:036:009 For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown:

 26:036:010 And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be builded:

 26:036:011 And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:036:012 Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men.

 26:036:013 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations:

 26:036:014 Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:036:015 Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:036:016 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:036:017 Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.

 26:036:018 Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it:

 26:036:019 And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.

 26:036:020 And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.

 26:036:021 But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.

 26:036:022 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.

 26:036:023 And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.

 26:036:024 For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.

 26:036:025 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.

 26:036:026 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.

 26:036:027 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.

 26:036:028 And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.

 26:036:029 I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.

 26:036:030 And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.

 26:036:031 Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.

 26:036:032 Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel.

 26:036:033 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded.

 26:036:034 And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.

 26:036:035 And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited.

 26:036:036 Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.

 26:036:037 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.

 26:036:038 As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:037:001 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones,

 26:037:002 And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.

 26:037:003 And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.

 26:037:004 Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.

 26:037:005 Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:

 26:037:006 And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:037:007 So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.

 26:037:008 And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.

 26:037:009 Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.

 26:037:010 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.

 26:037:011 Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.

 26:037:012 Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.

 26:037:013 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,

 26:037:014 And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD.

 26:037:015 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

 26:037:016 Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and for all the house of Israel his companions:

 26:037:017 And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.

 26:037:018 And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?

 26:037:019 Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.

 26:037:020 And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.

 26:037:021 And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:

 26:037:022 And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.

 26:037:023 Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.

 26:037:024 And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.

 26:037:025 And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant David shall be their prince for ever.

 26:037:026 Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.

 26:037:027 My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

 26:037:028 And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.

 26:038:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 26:038:002 Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,

 26:038:003 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:

 26:038:004 And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:

 26:038:005 Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet:

 26:038:006 Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee.

 26:038:007 Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.

 26:038:008 After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them.

 26:038:009 Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee.

 26:038:010 Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought:

 26:038:011 And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,

 26:038:012 To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.

 26:038:013 Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?

 26:038:014 Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know it?

 26:038:015 And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army:

 26:038:016 And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.

 26:038:017 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days many years that I would bring thee against them?

 26:038:018 And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, that my fury shall come up in my face.

 26:038:019 For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;

 26:038:020 So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.

 26:038:021 And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man's sword shall be against his brother.

 26:038:022 And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.

 26:038:023 Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:039:001 Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:

 26:039:002 And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel:

 26:039:003 And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.

 26:039:004 Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy bands, and the people that is with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.

 26:039:005 Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:039:006 And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

 26:039:007 So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.

 26:039:008 Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this is the day whereof I have spoken.

 26:039:009 And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:

 26:039:010 So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:039:011 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog.

 26:039:012 And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land.

 26:039:013 Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:039:014 And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.

 26:039:015 And the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.

 26:039:016 And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land.

 26:039:017 And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood.

 26:039:018 Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.

 26:039:019 And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.

 26:039:020 Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:039:021 And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.

 26:039:022 So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forward.

 26:039:023 And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword.

 26:039:024 According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.

 26:039:025 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;

 26:039:026 After that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid.

 26:039:027 When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;

 26:039:028 Then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there.

 26:039:029 Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:040:001 In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me thither.

 26:040:002 In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.

 26:040:003 And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.

 26:040:004 And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.

 26:040:005 And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.

 26:040:006 Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad.

 26:040:007 And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.

 26:040:008 He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.

 26:040:009 Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.

 26:040:010 And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.

 26:040:011 And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.

 26:040:012 The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.

 26:040:013 He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against door.

 26:040:014 He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.

 26:040:015 And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.

 26:040:016 And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows were round about inward: and upon each post were palm trees.

 26:040:017 Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.

 26:040:018 And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement.

 26:040:019 Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.

 26:040:020 And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.

 26:040:021 And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

 26:040:022 And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.

 26:040:023 And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits.

 26:040:024 After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.

 26:040:025 And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

 26:040:026 And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.

 26:040:027 And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.

 26:040:028 And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;

 26:040:029 And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.

 26:040:030 And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.

 26:040:031 And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps.

 26:040:032 And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures.

 26:040:033 And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, were according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.

 26:040:034 And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.

 26:040:035 And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according to these measures;

 26:040:036 The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

 26:040:037 And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.

 26:040:038 And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.

 26:040:039 And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.

 26:040:040 And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables.

 26:040:041 Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices.

 26:040:042 And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.

 26:040:043 And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.

 26:040:044 And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.

 26:040:045 And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.

 26:040:046 And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.

 26:040:047 So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.

 26:040:048 And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.

 26:040:049 The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.

 26:041:001 Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.

 26:041:002 And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.

 26:041:003 Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.

 26:041:004 So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.

 26:041:005 After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.

 26:041:006 And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.

 26:041:007 And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst.

 26:041:008 I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.

 26:041:009 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within.

 26:041:010 And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.

 26:041:011 And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.

 26:041:012 Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.

 26:041:013 So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;

 26:041:014 Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.

 26:041:015 And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;

 26:041:016 The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;

 26:041:017 To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.

 26:041:018 And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;

 26:041:019 So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about.

 26:041:020 From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple.

 26:041:021 The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.

 26:041:022 The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the LORD.

 26:041:023 And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.

 26:041:024 And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.

 26:041:025 And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without.

 26:041:026 And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.

 26:042:001 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.

 26:042:002 Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.

 26:042:003 Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.

 26:042:004 And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.

 26:042:005 Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.

 26:042:006 For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.

 26:042:007 And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.

 26:042:008 For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits.

 26:042:009 And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.

 26:042:010 The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.

 26:042:011 And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.

 26:042:012 And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.

 26:042:013 Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.

 26:042:014 When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people.

 26:042:015 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.

 26:042:016 He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.

 26:042:017 He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.

 26:042:018 He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.

 26:042:019 He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.

 26:042:020 He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.

 26:043:001 Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east:

 26:043:002 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.

 26:043:003 And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.

 26:043:004 And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.

 26:043:005 So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.

 26:043:006 And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me.

 26:043:007 And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.

 26:043:008 In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.

 26:043:009 Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.

 26:043:010 Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.

 26:043:011 And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.

 26:043:012 This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.

 26:043:013 And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher place of the altar.

 26:043:014 And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit.

 26:043:015 So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns.

 26:043:016 And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof.

 26:043:017 And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.

 26:043:018 And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.

 26:043:019 And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.

 26:043:020 And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.

 26:043:021 Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.

 26:043:022 And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.

 26:043:023 When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.

 26:043:024 And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the LORD.

 26:043:025 Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.

 26:043:026 Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.

 26:043:027 And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:044:001 Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.

 26:044:002 Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.

 26:044:003 It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.

 26:044:004 Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD: and I fell upon my face.

 26:044:005 And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.

 26:044:006 And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,

 26:044:007 In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.

 26:044:008 And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.

 26:044:009 Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel.

 26:044:010 And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.

 26:044:011 Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.

 26:044:012 Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.

 26:044:013 And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.

 26:044:014 But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.

 26:044:015 But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD:

 26:044:016 They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.

 26:044:017 And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.

 26:044:018 They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat.

 26:044:019 And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.

 26:044:020 Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.

 26:044:021 Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.

 26:044:022 Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.

 26:044:023 And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.

 26:044:024 And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.

 26:044:025 And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.

 26:044:026 And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.

 26:044:027 And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:044:028 And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I am their possession.

 26:044:029 They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering: and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.

 26:044:030 And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the priest's: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house.

 26:044:031 The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.

 26:045:001 Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.

 26:045:002 Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.

 26:045:003 And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place.

 26:045:004 The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the LORD: and it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the sanctuary.

 26:045:005 And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.

 26:045:006 And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.

 26:045:007 And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length shall be over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border.

 26:045:008 In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes.

 26:045:009 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:045:010 Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.

 26:045:011 The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.

 26:045:012 And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.

 26:045:013 This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley:

 26:045:014 Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer:

 26:045:015 And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:045:016 All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel.

 26:045:017 And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.

 26:045:018 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary:

 26:045:019 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.

 26:045:020 And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye reconcile the house.

 26:045:021 In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.

 26:045:022 And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.

 26:045:023 And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering.

 26:045:024 And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah.

 26:045:025 In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and according to the oil.

 26:046:001 Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.

 26:046:002 And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.

 26:046:003 Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.

 26:046:004 And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.

 26:046:005 And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.

 26:046:006 And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish.

 26:046:007 And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.

 26:046:008 And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.

 26:046:009 But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it.

 26:046:010 And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.

 26:046:011 And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.

 26:046:012 Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.

 26:046:013 Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning.

 26:046:014 And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD.

 26:046:015 Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.

 26:046:016 Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall be their possession by inheritance.

 26:046:017 But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them.

 26:046:018 Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.

 26:046:019 After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward.

 26:046:020 Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people.

 26:046:021 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.

 26:046:022 In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure.

 26:046:023 And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about.

 26:046:024 Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.

 26:047:001 Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.

 26:047:002 Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.

 26:047:003 And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ankles.

 26:047:004 Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins.

 26:047:005 Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.

 26:047:006 And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.

 26:047:007 Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.

 26:047:008 Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.

 26:047:009 And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh.

 26:047:010 And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.

 26:047:011 But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.

 26:047:012 And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.

 26:047:013 Thus saith the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.

 26:047:014 And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.

 26:047:015 And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;

 26:047:016 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.

 26:047:017 And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this is the north side.

 26:047:018 And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And this is the east side.

 26:047:019 And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south side southward.

 26:047:020 The west side also shall be the great sea from the border, till a man come over against Hamath. This is the west side.

 26:047:021 So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.

 26:047:022 And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.

 26:047:023 And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:048:001 Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to the coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath, Hazarenan, the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath; for these are his sides east and west; a portion for Dan.

 26:048:002 And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Asher.

 26:048:003 And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, a portion for Naphtali.

 26:048:004 And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Manasseh.

 26:048:005 And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Ephraim.

 26:048:006 And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side, a portion for Reuben.

 26:048:007 And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Judah.

 26:048:008 And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.

 26:048:009 The oblation that ye shall offer unto the LORD shall be of five and twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in breadth.

 26:048:010 And for them, even for the priests, shall be this holy oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand in length, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the midst thereof.

 26:048:011 It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.

 26:048:012 And this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites.

 26:048:013 And over against the border of the priests the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.

 26:048:014 And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the firstfruits of the land: for it is holy unto the LORD.

 26:048:015 And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane place for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall be in the midst thereof.

 26:048:016 And these shall be the measures thereof; the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.

 26:048:017 And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty.

 26:048:018 And the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy portion; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city.

 26:048:019 And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel.

 26:048:020 All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare, with the possession of the city.

 26:048:021 And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, over against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward over against the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, over against the portions for the prince: and it shall be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof.

 26:048:022 Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, shall be for the prince.

 26:048:023 As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the west side, Benjamin shall have a portion.

 26:048:024 And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side, Simeon shall have a portion.

 26:048:025 And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, Issachar a portion.

 26:048:026 And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side, Zebulun a portion.

 26:048:027 And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side, Gad a portion.

 26:048:028 And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of strife in Kadesh, and to the river toward the great sea.

 26:048:029 This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, saith the Lord GOD.

 26:048:030 And these are the goings out of the city on the north side, four thousand and five hundred measures.

 26:048:031 And the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel: three gates northward; one gate of Reuben, one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi.

 26:048:032 And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three gates; and one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate of Dan.

 26:048:033 And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures: and three gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one gate of Zebulun.

 26:048:034 At the west side four thousand and five hundred, with their three gates; one gate of Gad, one gate of Asher, one gate of Naphtali.

 26:048:035 It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.

 Book 27 Daniel

 27:001:001 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.

 27:001:002 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.

 27:001:003 And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;

 27:001:004 Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.

 27:001:005 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.

 27:001:006 Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:

 27:001:007 Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.

 27:001:008 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.

 27:001:009 Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.

 27:001:010 And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.

 27:001:011 Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,

 27:001:012 Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.

 27:001:013 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.

 27:001:014 So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.

 27:001:015 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.

 27:001:016 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.

 27:001:017 As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.

 27:001:018 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.

 27:001:019 And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.

 27:001:020 And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.

 27:001:021 And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.

 27:002:001 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.

 27:002:002 Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.

 27:002:003 And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.

 27:002:004 Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.

 27:002:005 The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.

 27:002:006 But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.

 27:002:007 They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.

 27:002:008 The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.

 27:002:009 But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.

 27:002:010 The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.

 27:002:011 And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.

 27:002:012 For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.

 27:002:013 And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.

 27:002:014 Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:

 27:002:015 He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.

 27:002:016 Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.

 27:002:017 Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:

 27:002:018 That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.

 27:002:019 Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.

 27:002:020 Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:

 27:002:021 And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:

 27:002:022 He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.

 27:002:023 I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.

 27:002:024 Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.

 27:002:025 Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.

 27:002:026 The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?

 27:002:027 Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;

 27:002:028 But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;

 27:002:029 As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.

 27:002:030 But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.

 27:002:031 Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.

 27:002:032 This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,

 27:002:033 His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.

 27:002:034 Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.

 27:002:035 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.

 27:002:036 This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.

 27:002:037 Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.

 27:002:038 And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.

 27:002:039 And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.

 27:002:040 And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.

 27:002:041 And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.

 27:002:042 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.

 27:002:043 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.

 27:002:044 And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.

 27:002:045 Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.

 27:002:046 Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.

 27:002:047 The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.

 27:002:048 Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.

 27:002:049 Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.

 27:003:001 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.

 27:003:002 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.

 27:003:003 Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

 27:003:004 Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,

 27:003:005 That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:

 27:003:006 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.

 27:003:007 Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.

 27:003:008 Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.

 27:003:009 They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.

 27:003:010 Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:

 27:003:011 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.

 27:003:012 There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.

 27:003:013 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.

 27:003:014 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?

 27:003:015 Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?

 27:003:016 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.

 27:003:017 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.

 27:003:018 But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.

 27:003:019 Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.

 27:003:020 And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.

 27:003:021 Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.

 27:003:022 Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

 27:003:023 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.

 27:003:024 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.

 27:003:025 He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.

 27:003:026 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.

 27:003:027 And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.

 27:003:028 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.

 27:003:029 Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.

 27:003:030 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.

 27:004:001 Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.

 27:004:002 I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me.

 27:004:003 How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.

 27:004:004 I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace:

 27:004:005 I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.

 27:004:006 Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.

 27:004:007 Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.

 27:004:008 But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,

 27:004:009 O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.

 27:004:010 Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.

 27:004:011 The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:

 27:004:012 The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.

 27:004:013 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;

 27:004:014 He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:

 27:004:015 Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:

 27:004:016 Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.

 27:004:017 This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.

 27:004:018 This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.

 27:004:019 Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.

 27:004:020 The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;

 27:004:021 Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:

 27:004:022 It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.

 27:004:023 And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;

 27:004:024 This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:

 27:004:025 That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.

 27:004:026 And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.

 27:004:027 Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.

 27:004:028 All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.

 27:004:029 At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.

 27:004:030 The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?

 27:004:031 While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.

 27:004:032 And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.

 27:004:033 The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.

 27:004:034 And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:

 27:004:035 And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?

 27:004:036 At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.

 27:004:037 Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.

 27:005:001 Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.

 27:005:002 Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.

 27:005:003 Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.

 27:005:004 They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.

 27:005:005 In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.

 27:005:006 Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.

 27:005:007 The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.

 27:005:008 Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.

 27:005:009 Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.

 27:005:010 Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:

 27:005:011 There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;

 27:005:012 Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.

 27:005:013 Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?

 27:005:014 I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.

 27:005:015 And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing:

 27:005:016 And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.

 27:005:017 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.

 27:005:018 O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:

 27:005:019 And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.

 27:005:020 But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:

 27:005:021 And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.

 27:005:022 And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;

 27:005:023 But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:

 27:005:024 Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.

 27:005:025 And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.

 27:005:026 This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.

 27:005:027 TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.

 27:005:028 PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.

 27:005:029 Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.

 27:005:030 In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.

 27:005:031 And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.

 27:006:001 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;

 27:006:002 And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.

 27:006:003 Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.

 27:006:004 Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.

 27:006:005 Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.

 27:006:006 Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.

 27:006:007 All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.

 27:006:008 Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.

 27:006:009 Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.

 27:006:010 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.

 27:006:011 Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.

 27:006:012 Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.

 27:006:013 Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.

 27:006:014 Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.

 27:006:015 Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.

 27:006:016 Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.

 27:006:017 And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.

 27:006:018 Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.

 27:006:019 Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.

 27:006:020 And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?

 27:006:021 Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.

 27:006:022 My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.

 27:006:023 Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.

 27:006:024 And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.

 27:006:025 Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.

 27:006:026 I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.

 27:006:027 He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.

 27:006:028 So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

 27:007:001 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.

 27:007:002 Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.

 27:007:003 And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.

 27:007:004 The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.

 27:007:005 And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.

 27:007:006 After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.

 27:007:007 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.

 27:007:008 I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.

 27:007:009 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.

 27:007:010 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.

 27:007:011 I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.

 27:007:012 As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.

 27:007:013 I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.

 27:007:014 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.

 27:007:015 I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.

 27:007:016 I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.

 27:007:017 These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.

 27:007:018 But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.

 27:007:019 Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;

 27:007:020 And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.

 27:007:021 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;

 27:007:022 Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.

 27:007:023 Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.

 27:007:024 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.

 27:007:025 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.

 27:007:026 But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.

 27:007:027 And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.

 27:007:028 Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.

 27:008:001 In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.

 27:008:002 And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.

 27:008:003 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.

 27:008:004 I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.

 27:008:005 And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.

 27:008:006 And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.

 27:008:007 And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.

 27:008:008 Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.

 27:008:009 And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.

 27:008:010 And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.

 27:008:011 Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary was cast down.

 27:008:012 And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.

 27:008:013 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?

 27:008:014 And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.

 27:008:015 And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.

 27:008:016 And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.

 27:008:017 So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.

 27:008:018 Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.

 27:008:019 And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.

 27:008:020 The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.

 27:008:021 And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.

 27:008:022 Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.

 27:008:023 And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.

 27:008:024 And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.

 27:008:025 And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.

 27:008:026 And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.

 27:008:027 And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.

 27:009:001 In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;

 27:009:002 In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.

 27:009:003 And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:

 27:009:004 And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;

 27:009:005 We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:

 27:009:006 Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.

 27:009:007 O LORD, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.

 27:009:008 O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.

 27:009:009 To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;

 27:009:010 Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.

 27:009:011 Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.

 27:009:012 And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.

 27:009:013 As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.

 27:009:014 Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.

 27:009:015 And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.

 27:009:016 O LORD, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.

 27:009:017 Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.

 27:009:018 O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.

 27:009:019 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.

 27:009:020 And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;

 27:009:021 Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.

 27:009:022 And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.

 27:009:023 At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.

 27:009:024 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.

 27:009:025 Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.

 27:009:026 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.

 27:009:027 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

 27:010:001 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.

 27:010:002 In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.

 27:010:003 I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.

 27:010:004 And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;

 27:010:005 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:

 27:010:006 His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.

 27:010:007 And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.

 27:010:008 Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.

 27:010:009 Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.

 27:010:010 And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.

 27:010:011 And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.

 27:010:012 Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.

 27:010:013 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.

 27:010:014 Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.

 27:010:015 And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.

 27:010:016 And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.

 27:010:017 For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.

 27:010:018 Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,

 27:010:019 And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.

 27:010:020 Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.

 27:010:021 But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.

 27:011:001 Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.

 27:011:002 And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.

 27:011:003 And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.

 27:011:004 And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.

 27:011:005 And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.

 27:011:006 And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.

 27:011:007 But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:

 27:011:008 And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.

 27:011:009 So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.

 27:011:010 But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.

 27:011:011 And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.

 27:011:012 And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.

 27:011:013 For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.

 27:011:014 And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.

 27:011:015 So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.

 27:011:016 But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.

 27:011:017 He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.

 27:011:018 After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.

 27:011:019 Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.

 27:011:020 Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.

 27:011:021 And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.

 27:011:022 And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.

 27:011:023 And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.

 27:011:024 He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.

 27:011:025 And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.

 27:011:026 Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.

 27:011:027 And both of these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.

 27:011:028 Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land.

 27:011:029 At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.

 27:011:030 For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.

 27:011:031 And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.

 27:011:032 And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.

 27:011:033 And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days.

 27:011:034 Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.

 27:011:035 And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.

 27:011:036 And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.

 27:011:037 Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.

 27:011:038 But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.

 27:011:039 Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.

 27:011:040 And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.

 27:011:041 He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.

 27:011:042 He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.

 27:011:043 But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.

 27:011:044 But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.

 27:011:045 And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.

 27:012:001 And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.

 27:012:002 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.

 27:012:003 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.

 27:012:004 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.

 27:012:005 Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river.

 27:012:006 And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?

 27:012:007 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.

 27:012:008 And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?

 27:012:009 And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.

 27:012:010 Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.

 27:012:011 And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.

 27:012:012 Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.

 27:012:013 But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.

 Book 28 Hosea

 28:001:001 The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.

 28:001:002 The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the LORD.

 28:001:003 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.

 28:001:004 And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.

 28:001:005 And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.

 28:001:006 And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.

 28:001:007 But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.

 28:001:008 Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.

 28:001:009 Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.

 28:001:010 Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.

 28:001:011 Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.

 28:002:001 Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.

 28:002:002 Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;

 28:002:003 Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.

 28:002:004 And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms.

 28:002:005 For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.

 28:002:006 Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.

 28:002:007 And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.

 28:002:008 For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.

 28:002:009 Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.

 28:002:010 And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.

 28:002:011 I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.

 28:002:012 And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.

 28:002:013 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.

 28:002:014 Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.

 28:002:015 And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.

 28:002:016 And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.

 28:002:017 For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.

 28:002:018 And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.

 28:002:019 And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.

 28:002:020 I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.

 28:002:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;

 28:002:022 And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.

 28:002:023 And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.

 28:003:001 Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.

 28:003:002 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:

 28:003:003 And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee.

 28:003:004 For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:

 28:003:005 Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.

 28:004:001 Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.

 28:004:002 By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.

 28:004:003 Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.

 28:004:004 Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.

 28:004:005 Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.

 28:004:006 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.

 28:004:007 As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.

 28:004:008 They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.

 28:004:009 And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.

 28:004:010 For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.

 28:004:011 Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.

 28:004:012 My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.

 28:004:013 They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.

 28:004:014 I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.

 28:004:015 Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.

 28:004:016 For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.

 28:004:017 Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.

 28:004:018 Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.

 28:004:019 The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.

 28:005:001 Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.

 28:005:002 And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all.

 28:005:003 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled.

 28:005:004 They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.

 28:005:005 And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity: Judah also shall fall with them.

 28:005:006 They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them.

 28:005:007 They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.

 28:005:008 Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.

 28:005:009 Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.

 28:005:010 The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.

 28:005:011 Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.

 28:005:012 Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.

 28:005:013 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.

 28:005:014 For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him.

 28:005:015 I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.

 28:006:001 Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.

 28:006:002 After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.

 28:006:003 Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.

 28:006:004 O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.

 28:006:005 Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.

 28:006:006 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.

 28:006:007 But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.

 28:006:008 Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.

 28:006:009 And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.

 28:006:010 I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.

 28:006:011 Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.

 28:007:001 When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.

 28:007:002 And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.

 28:007:003 They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.

 28:007:004 They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.

 28:007:005 In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.

 28:007:006 For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.

 28:007:007 They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.

 28:007:008 Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.

 28:007:009 Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.

 28:007:010 And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.

 28:007:011 Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.

 28:007:012 When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.

 28:007:013 Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.

 28:007:014 And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me.

 28:007:015 Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.

 28:007:016 They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.

 28:008:001 Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.

 28:008:002 Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.

 28:008:003 Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him.

 28:008:004 They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.

 28:008:005 Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?

 28:008:006 For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.

 28:008:007 For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.

 28:008:008 Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.

 28:008:009 For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.

 28:008:010 Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.

 28:008:011 Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.

 28:008:012 I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.

 28:008:013 They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.

 28:008:014 For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.

 28:009:001 Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.

 28:009:002 The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.

 28:009:003 They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.

 28:009:004 They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.

 28:009:005 What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?

 28:009:006 For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tabernacles.

 28:009:007 The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred.

 28:009:008 The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.

 28:009:009 They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.

 28:009:010 I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.

 28:009:011 As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.

 28:009:012 Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!

 28:009:013 Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.

 28:009:014 Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.

 28:009:015 All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes are revolters.

 28:009:016 Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.

 28:009:017 My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.

 28:010:001 Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.

 28:010:002 Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.

 28:010:003 For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?

 28:010:004 They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.

 28:010:005 The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.

 28:010:006 It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.

 28:010:007 As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.

 28:010:008 The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.

 28:010:009 O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.

 28:010:010 It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.

 28:010:011 And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.

 28:010:012 Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.

 28:010:013 Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.

 28:010:014 Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children.

 28:010:015 So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.

 28:011:001 When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.

 28:011:002 As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.

 28:011:003 I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.

 28:011:004 I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.

 28:011:005 He shall not return into the land of Egypt, and the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.

 28:011:006 And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.

 28:011:007 And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.

 28:011:008 How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.

 28:011:009 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.

 28:011:010 They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.

 28:011:011 They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.

 28:011:012 Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.

 28:012:001 Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.

 28:012:002 The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.

 28:012:003 He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:

 28:012:004 Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spake with us;

 28:012:005 Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial.

 28:012:006 Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment and wait on thy God continually.

 28:012:007 He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress.

 28:012:008 And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin.

 28:012:009 And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.

 28:012:010 I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.

 28:012:011 Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields.

 28:012:012 And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.

 28:012:013 And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.

 28:012:014 Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his LORD return unto him.

 28:013:001 When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.

 28:013:002 And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.

 28:013:003 Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.

 28:013:004 Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me.

 28:013:005 I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.

 28:013:006 According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.

 28:013:007 Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe them:

 28:013:008 I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.

 28:013:009 O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help.

 28:013:010 I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?

 28:013:011 I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath.

 28:013:012 The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.

 28:013:013 The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children.

 28:013:014 I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.

 28:013:015 Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.

 28:013:016 Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.

 28:014:001 O israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.

 28:014:002 Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.

 28:014:003 Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.

 28:014:004 I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.

 28:014:005 I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.

 28:014:006 His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.

 28:014:007 They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.

 28:014:008 Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.

 28:014:009 Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.

 Book 29 Joel

 29:001:001 The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.

 29:001:002 Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?

 29:001:003 Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation.

 29:001:004 That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.

 29:001:005 Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.

 29:001:006 For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.

 29:001:007 He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.

 29:001:008 Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.

 29:001:009 The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn.

 29:001:010 The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.

 29:001:011 Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.

 29:001:012 The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.

 29:001:013 Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.

 29:001:014 Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD,

 29:001:015 Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.

 29:001:016 Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God?

 29:001:017 The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.

 29:001:018 How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.

 29:001:019 O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.

 29:001:020 The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.

 29:002:001 Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand;

 29:002:002 A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations.

 29:002:003 A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.

 29:002:004 The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.

 29:002:005 Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.

 29:002:006 Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.

 29:002:007 They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks:

 29:002:008 Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.

 29:002:009 They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.

 29:002:010 The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:

 29:002:011 And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?

 29:002:012 Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:

 29:002:013 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.

 29:002:014 Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God?

 29:002:015 Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:

 29:002:016 Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.

 29:002:017 Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?

 29:002:018 Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people.

 29:002:019 Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen:

 29:002:020 But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things.

 29:002:021 Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things.

 29:002:022 Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength.

 29:002:023 Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.

 29:002:024 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.

 29:002:025 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.

 29:002:026 And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.

 29:002:027 And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.

 29:002:028 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:

 29:002:029 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.

 29:002:030 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.

 29:002:031 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.

 29:002:032 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.

 29:003:001 For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,

 29:003:002 I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.

 29:003:003 And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.

 29:003:004 Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head;

 29:003:005 Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things:

 29:003:006 The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border.

 29:003:007 Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head:

 29:003:008 And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the LORD hath spoken it.

 29:003:009 Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:

 29:003:010 Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.

 29:003:011 Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD.

 29:003:012 Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.

 29:003:013 Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great.

 29:003:014 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.

 29:003:015 The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.

 29:003:016 The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.

 29:003:017 So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.

 29:003:018 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.

 29:003:019 Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.

 29:003:020 But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.

 29:003:021 For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the LORD dwelleth in Zion.

 Book 30 Amos

 30:001:001 The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.

 30:001:002 And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.

 30:001:003 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:

 30:001:004 But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.

 30:001:005 I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD.

 30:001:006 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:

 30:001:007 But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof:

 30:001:008 And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord GOD.

 30:001:009 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:

 30:001:010 But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the palaces thereof.

 30:001:011 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever:

 30:001:012 But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.

 30:001:013 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border:

 30:001:014 But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:

 30:001:015 And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the LORD.

 30:002:001 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:

 30:002:002 But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:

 30:002:003 And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.

 30:002:004 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:

 30:002:005 But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.

 30:002:006 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;

 30:002:007 That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid, to profane my holy name:

 30:002:008 And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god.

 30:002:009 Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.

 30:002:010 Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.

 30:002:011 And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.

 30:002:012 But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.

 30:002:013 Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves.

 30:002:014 Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:

 30:002:015 Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.

 30:002:016 And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.

 30:003:001 Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,

 30:003:002 You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.

 30:003:003 Can two walk together, except they be agreed?

 30:003:004 Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?

 30:003:005 Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?

 30:003:006 Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it?

 30:003:007 Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

 30:003:008 The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy?

 30:003:009 Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof.

 30:003:010 For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.

 30:003:011 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled.

 30:003:012 Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.

 30:003:013 Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,

 30:003:014 That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.

 30:003:015 And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the LORD.

 30:004:001 Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.

 30:004:002 The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.

 30:004:003 And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith the LORD.

 30:004:004 Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years:

 30:004:005 And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.

 30:004:006 And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

 30:004:007 And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.

 30:004:008 So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

 30:004:009 I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

 30:004:010 I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

 30:004:011 I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

 30:004:012 Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.

 30:004:013 For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.

 30:005:001 Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel.

 30:005:002 The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.

 30:005:003 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.

 30:005:004 For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:

 30:005:005 But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.

 30:005:006 Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.

 30:005:007 Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,

 30:005:008 Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:

 30:005:009 That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.

 30:005:010 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.

 30:005:011 Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.

 30:005:012 For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.

 30:005:013 Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.

 30:005:014 Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.

 30:005:015 Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.

 30:005:016 Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.

 30:005:017 And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.

 30:005:018 Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.

 30:005:019 As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.

 30:005:020 Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?

 30:005:021 I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.

 30:005:022 Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.

 30:005:023 Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.

 30:005:024 But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.

 30:005:025 Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?

 30:005:026 But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.

 30:005:027 Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.

 30:006:001 Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!

 30:006:002 Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?

 30:006:003 Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;

 30:006:004 That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;

 30:006:005 That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David;

 30:006:006 That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.

 30:006:007 Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.

 30:006:008 The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.

 30:006:009 And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.

 30:006:010 And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.

 30:006:011 For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.

 30:006:012 Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:

 30:006:013 Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?

 30:006:014 But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.

 30:007:001 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.

 30:007:002 And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.

 30:007:003 The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.

 30:007:004 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.

 30:007:005 Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.

 30:007:006 The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.

 30:007:007 Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the LORD stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.

 30:007:008 And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the LORD, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:

 30:007:009 And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.

 30:007:010 Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.

 30:007:011 For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.

 30:007:012 Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:

 30:007:013 But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court.

 30:007:014 Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:

 30:007:015 And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.

 30:007:016 Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac.

 30:007:017 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.

 30:008:001 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and behold a basket of summer fruit.

 30:008:002 And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.

 30:008:003 And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.

 30:008:004 Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,

 30:008:005 Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?

 30:008:006 That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?

 30:008:007 The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.

 30:008:008 Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.

 30:008:009 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day:

 30:008:010 And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.

 30:008:011 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:

 30:008:012 And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.

 30:008:013 In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.

 30:008:014 They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again.

 30:009:001 I saw the LORD standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.

 30:009:002 Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:

 30:009:003 And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:

 30:009:004 And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.

 30:009:005 And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.

 30:009:006 It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.

 30:009:007 Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?

 30:009:008 Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.

 30:009:009 For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.

 30:009:010 All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.

 30:009:011 In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:

 30:009:012 That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.

 30:009:013 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.

 30:009:014 And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.

 30:009:015 And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God.

 Book 31 Obadiah

 31:001:001 The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.

 31:001:002 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised.

 31:001:003 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?

 31:001:004 Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.

 31:001:005 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?

 31:001:006 How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up!

 31:001:007 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; that they eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.

 31:001:008 Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?

 31:001:009 And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.

 31:001:010 For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.

 31:001:011 In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.

 31:001:012 But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.

 31:001:013 Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;

 31:001:014 Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.

 31:001:015 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.

 31:001:016 For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.

 31:001:017 But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.

 31:001:018 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it.

 31:001:019 And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.

 31:001:020 And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south.

 31:001:021 And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD's.

 Book 32 Jonah

 32:001:001 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,

 32:001:002 Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.

 32:001:003 But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.

 32:001:004 But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.

 32:001:005 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.

 32:001:006 So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.

 32:001:007 And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.

 32:001:008 Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?

 32:001:009 And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.

 32:001:010 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.

 32:001:011 Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.

 32:001:012 And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.

 32:001:013 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.

 32:001:014 Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee.

 32:001:015 So they look up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.

 32:001:016 Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.

 32:001:017 Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.

 32:002:001 Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,

 32:002:002 And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice.

 32:002:003 For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.

 32:002:004 Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.

 32:002:005 The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.

 32:002:006 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.

 32:002:007 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.

 32:002:008 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.

 32:002:009 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.

 32:002:010 And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.

 32:003:001 And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,

 32:003:002 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.

 32:003:003 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey.

 32:003:004 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.

 32:003:005 So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.

 32:003:006 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.

 32:003:007 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:

 32:003:008 But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.

 32:003:009 Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?

 32:003:010 And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.

 32:004:001 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.

 32:004:002 And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.

 32:004:003 Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.

 32:004:004 Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?

 32:004:005 So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.

 32:004:006 And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.

 32:004:007 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.

 32:004:008 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.

 32:004:009 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.

 32:004:010 Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:

 32:004:011 And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?

 Book 33 Micah

 33:001:001 The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.

 33:001:002 Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the LORD from his holy temple.

 33:001:003 For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.

 33:001:004 And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep place.

 33:001:005 For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?

 33:001:006 Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.

 33:001:007 And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.

 33:001:008 Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.

 33:001:009 For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.

 33:001:010 Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.

 33:001:011 Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.

 33:001:012 For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.

 33:001:013 O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.

 33:001:014 Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.

 33:001:015 Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.

 33:001:016 Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.

 33:002:001 Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.

 33:002:002 And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.

 33:002:003 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.

 33:002:004 In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.

 33:002:005 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.

 33:002:006 Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.

 33:002:007 O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?

 33:002:008 Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.

 33:002:009 The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.

 33:002:010 Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.

 33:002:011 If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.

 33:002:012 I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.

 33:002:013 The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.

 33:003:001 And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment?

 33:003:002 Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;

 33:003:003 Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.

 33:003:004 Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.

 33:003:005 Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.

 33:003:006 Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.

 33:003:007 Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.

 33:003:008 But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.

 33:003:009 Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.

 33:003:010 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.

 33:003:011 The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.

 33:003:012 Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.

 33:004:001 But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.

 33:004:002 And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.

 33:004:003 And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.

 33:004:004 But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken it.

 33:004:005 For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.

 33:004:006 In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;

 33:004:007 And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.

 33:004:008 And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.

 33:004:009 Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.

 33:004:010 Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go even to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.

 33:004:011 Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.

 33:004:012 But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.

 33:004:013 Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.

 33:005:001 Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.

 33:005:002 But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.

 33:005:003 Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.

 33:005:004 And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.

 33:005:005 And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.

 33:005:006 And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.

 33:005:007 And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.

 33:005:008 And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.

 33:005:009 Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.

 33:005:010 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots:

 33:005:011 And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds:

 33:005:012 And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers:

 33:005:013 Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.

 33:005:014 And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.

 33:005:015 And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.

 33:006:001 Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.

 33:006:002 Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD's controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.

 33:006:003 O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.

 33:006:004 For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

 33:006:005 O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.

 33:006:006 Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?

 33:006:007 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

 33:006:008 He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?

 33:006:009 The LORD's voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.

 33:006:010 Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?

 33:006:011 Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?

 33:006:012 For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.

 33:006:013 Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making thee desolate because of thy sins.

 33:006:014 Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.

 33:006:015 Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.

 33:006:016 For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.

 33:007:001 Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.

 33:007:002 The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.

 33:007:003 That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.

 33:007:004 The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.

 33:007:005 Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.

 33:007:006 For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.

 33:007:007 Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.

 33:007:008 Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me.

 33:007:009 I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.

 33:007:010 Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.

 33:007:011 In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the decree be far removed.

 33:007:012 In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.

 33:007:013 Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.

 33:007:014 Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.

 33:007:015 According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things.

 33:007:016 The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.

 33:007:017 They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.

 33:007:018 Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.

 33:007:019 He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.

 33:007:020 Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.

 Book 34 Nahum

 34:001:001 The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.

 34:001:002 God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.

 34:001:003 The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.

 34:001:004 He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.

 34:001:005 The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.

 34:001:006 Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.

 34:001:007 The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.

 34:001:008 But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.

 34:001:009 What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.

 34:001:010 For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.

 34:001:011 There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counsellor.

 34:001:012 Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.

 34:001:013 For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.

 34:001:014 And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.

 34:001:015 Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.

 34:002:001 He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily.

 34:002:002 For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches.

 34:002:003 The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.

 34:002:004 The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.

 34:002:005 He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.

 34:002:006 The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.

 34:002:007 And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.

 34:002:008 But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back.

 34:002:009 Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture.

 34:002:010 She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.

 34:002:011 Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?

 34:002:012 The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.

 34:002:013 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.

 34:003:001 Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery; the prey departeth not;

 34:003:002 The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots.

 34:003:003 The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:

 34:003:004 Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.

 34:003:005 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.

 34:003:006 And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.

 34:003:007 And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?

 34:003:008 Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the sea?

 34:003:009 Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.

 34:003:010 Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.

 34:003:011 Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy.

 34:003:012 All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.

 34:003:013 Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars.

 34:003:014 Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.

 34:003:015 There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.

 34:003:016 Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away.

 34:003:017 Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.

 34:003:018 Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell in the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth them.

 34:003:019 There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?

 Book 35 Habakkuk

 35:001:001 The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.

 35:001:002 O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!

 35:001:003 Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.

 35:001:004 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.

 35:001:005 Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which ye will not believe, though it be told you.

 35:001:006 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not their's.

 35:001:007 They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.

 35:001:008 Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.

 35:001:009 They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.

 35:001:010 And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.

 35:001:011 Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god.

 35:001:012 Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.

 35:001:013 Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?

 35:001:014 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?

 35:001:015 They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.

 35:001:016 Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous.

 35:001:017 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?

 35:002:001 I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.

 35:002:002 And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.

 35:002:003 For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.

 35:002:004 Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.

 35:002:005 Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:

 35:002:006 Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!

 35:002:007 Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?

 35:002:008 Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.

 35:002:009 Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!

 35:002:010 Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned against thy soul.

 35:002:011 For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.

 35:002:012 Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!

 35:002:013 Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?

 35:002:014 For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.

 35:002:015 Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!

 35:002:016 Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD's right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory.

 35:002:017 For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.

 35:002:018 What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?

 35:002:019 Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.

 35:002:020 But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.

 35:003:001 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.

 35:003:002 O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.

 35:003:003 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.

 35:003:004 And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.

 35:003:005 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.

 35:003:006 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.

 35:003:007 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.

 35:003:008 Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?

 35:003:009 Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.

 35:003:010 The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.

 35:003:011 The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.

 35:003:012 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.

 35:003:013 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.

 35:003:014 Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.

 35:003:015 Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the heap of great waters.

 35:003:016 When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.

 35:003:017 Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:

 35:003:018 Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.

 35:003:019 The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.

 Book 36 Zephaniah

 36:001:001 The word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.

 36:001:002 I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the LORD.

 36:001:003 I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked: and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the LORD.

 36:001:004 I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests;

 36:001:005 And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;

 36:001:006 And them that are turned back from the LORD; and those that have not sought the LORD, nor enquired for him.

 36:001:007 Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD is at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his guests.

 36:001:008 And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD's sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with strange apparel.

 36:001:009 In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.

 36:001:010 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.

 36:001:011 Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.

 36:001:012 And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.

 36:001:013 Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.

 36:001:014 The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.

 36:001:015 That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,

 36:001:016 A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.

 36:001:017 And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.

 36:001:018 Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.

 36:002:001 Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired;

 36:002:002 Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you, before the day of the LORD's anger come upon you.

 36:002:003 Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD's anger.

 36:002:004 For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.

 36:002:005 Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.

 36:002:006 And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks.

 36:002:007 And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity.

 36:002:008 I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.

 36:002:009 Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.

 36:002:010 This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the LORD of hosts.

 36:002:011 The LORD will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the heathen.

 36:002:012 Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.

 36:002:013 And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like a wilderness.

 36:002:014 And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds; for he shall uncover the cedar work.

 36:002:015 This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.

 36:003:001 Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!

 36:003:002 She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.

 36:003:003 Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.

 36:003:004 Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.

 36:003:005 The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.

 36:003:006 I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.

 36:003:007 I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings.

 36:003:008 Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.

 36:003:009 For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.

 36:003:010 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.

 36:003:011 In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.

 36:003:012 I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.

 36:003:013 The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

 36:003:014 Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.

 36:003:015 The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.

 36:003:016 In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.

 36:003:017 The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.

 36:003:018 I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.

 36:003:019 Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.

 36:003:020 At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.

 Book 37 Haggai

 37:001:001 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,

 37:001:002 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD's house should be built.

 37:001:003 Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,

 37:001:004 Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this house lie waste?

 37:001:005 Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.

 37:001:006 Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.

 37:001:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.

 37:001:008 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD.

 37:001:009 Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house.

 37:001:010 Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.

 37:001:011 And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.

 37:001:012 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD.

 37:001:013 Then spake Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD.

 37:001:014 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,

 37:001:015 In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.

 37:002:001 In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying,

 37:002:002 Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,

 37:002:003 Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?

 37:002:004 Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts:

 37:002:005 According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.

 37:002:006 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;

 37:002:007 And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts.

 37:002:008 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.

 37:002:009 The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts.

 37:002:010 In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,

 37:002:011 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,

 37:002:012 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.

 37:002:013 Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.

 37:002:014 Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.

 37:002:015 And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:

 37:002:016 Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.

 37:002:017 I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the LORD.

 37:002:018 Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider it.

 37:002:019 Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.

 37:002:020 And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,

 37:002:021 Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;

 37:002:022 And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.

 37:002:023 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.

 Book 38 Zechariah

 38:001:001 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,

 38:001:002 The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.

 38:001:003 Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.

 38:001:004 Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.

 38:001:005 Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?

 38:001:006 But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.

 38:001:007 Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,

 38:001:008 I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.

 38:001:009 Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.

 38:001:010 And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.

 38:001:011 And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.

 38:001:012 Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?

 38:001:013 And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words.

 38:001:014 So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.

 38:001:015 And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.

 38:001:016 Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.

 38:001:017 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.

 38:001:018 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.

 38:001:019 And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.

 38:001:020 And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.

 38:001:021 Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.

 38:002:001 I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.

 38:002:002 Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.

 38:002:003 And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,

 38:002:004 And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:

 38:002:005 For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.

 38:002:006 Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.

 38:002:007 Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.

 38:002:008 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.

 38:002:009 For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.

 38:002:010 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.

 38:002:011 And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.

 38:002:012 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.

 38:002:013 Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.

 38:003:001 And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.

 38:003:002 And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?

 38:003:003 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.

 38:003:004 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.

 38:003:005 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.

 38:003:006 And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,

 38:003:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.

 38:003:008 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.

 38:003:009 For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.

 38:003:010 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.

 38:004:001 And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.

 38:004:002 And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof:

 38:004:003 And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.

 38:004:004 So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?

 38:004:005 Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.

 38:004:006 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.

 38:004:007 Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.

 38:004:008 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 38:004:009 The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.

 38:004:010 For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.

 38:004:011 Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?

 38:004:012 And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?

 38:004:013 And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.

 38:004:014 Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth.

 38:005:001 Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.

 38:005:002 And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.

 38:005:003 Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.

 38:005:004 I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.

 38:005:005 Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.

 38:005:006 And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance through all the earth.

 38:005:007 And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.

 38:005:008 And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.

 38:005:009 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.

 38:005:010 Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?

 38:005:011 And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.

 38:006:001 And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.

 38:006:002 In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;

 38:006:003 And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.

 38:006:004 Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?

 38:006:005 And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the LORD of all the earth.

 38:006:006 The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country.

 38:006:007 And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.

 38:006:008 Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.

 38:006:009 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

 38:006:010 Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;

 38:006:011 Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;

 38:006:012 And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:

 38:006:013 Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.

 38:006:014 And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.

 38:006:015 And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.

 38:007:001 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu;

 38:007:002 When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,

 38:007:003 And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?

 38:007:004 Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,

 38:007:005 Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?

 38:007:006 And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?

 38:007:007 Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and the plain?

 38:007:008 And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,

 38:007:009 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother:

 38:007:010 And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.

 38:007:011 But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.

 38:007:012 Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.

 38:007:013 Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:

 38:007:014 But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.

 38:008:001 Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,

 38:008:002 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.

 38:008:003 Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.

 38:008:004 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.

 38:008:005 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.

 38:008:006 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.

 38:008:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;

 38:008:008 And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.

 38:008:009 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.

 38:008:010 For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour.

 38:008:011 But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts.

 38:008:012 For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.

 38:008:013 And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong.

 38:008:014 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not:

 38:008:015 So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.

 38:008:016 These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates:

 38:008:017 And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith the LORD.

 38:008:018 And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,

 38:008:019 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace.

 38:008:020 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:

 38:008:021 And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I will go also.

 38:008:022 Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.

 38:008:023 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you.

 38:009:001 The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD.

 38:009:002 And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise.

 38:009:003 And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.

 38:009:004 Behold, the LORD will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.

 38:009:005 Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.

 38:009:006 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.

 38:009:007 And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.

 38:009:008 And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.

 38:009:009 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.

 38:009:010 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.

 38:009:011 As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.

 38:009:012 Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare that I will render double unto thee;

 38:009:013 When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.

 38:009:014 And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the LORD God shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.

 38:009:015 The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners of the altar.

 38:009:016 And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.

 38:009:017 For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.

 38:010:001 Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.

 38:010:002 For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd.

 38:010:003 Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.

 38:010:004 Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.

 38:010:005 And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.

 38:010:006 And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God, and will hear them.

 38:010:007 And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.

 38:010:008 I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased.

 38:010:009 And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.

 38:010:010 I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them.

 38:010:011 And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.

 38:010:012 And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD.

 38:011:001 Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.

 38:011:002 Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.

 38:011:003 There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.

 38:011:004 Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;

 38:011:005 Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.

 38:011:006 For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.

 38:011:007 And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.

 38:011:008 Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.

 38:011:009 Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.

 38:011:010 And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.

 38:011:011 And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD.

 38:011:012 And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.

 38:011:013 And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.

 38:011:014 Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.

 38:011:015 And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.

 38:011:016 For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.

 38:011:017 Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.

 38:012:001 The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.

 38:012:002 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.

 38:012:003 And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.

 38:012:004 In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness.

 38:012:005 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God.

 38:012:006 In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem.

 38:012:007 The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah.

 38:012:008 In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the LORD before them.

 38:012:009 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.

 38:012:010 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.

 38:012:011 In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.

 38:012:012 And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;

 38:012:013 The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;

 38:012:014 All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.

 38:013:001 In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.

 38:013:002 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.

 38:013:003 And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.

 38:013:004 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:

 38:013:005 But he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.

 38:013:006 And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.

 38:013:007 Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.

 38:013:008 And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.

 38:013:009 And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.

 38:014:001 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.

 38:014:002 For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.

 38:014:003 Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.

 38:014:004 And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.

 38:014:005 And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with thee.

 38:014:006 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark:

 38:014:007 But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light.

 38:014:008 And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.

 38:014:009 And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one.

 38:014:010 All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king's winepresses.

 38:014:011 And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.

 38:014:012 And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.

 38:014:013 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour.

 38:014:014 And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.

 38:014:015 And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.

 38:014:016 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.

 38:014:017 And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.

 38:014:018 And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.

 38:014:019 This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.

 38:014:020 In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD's house shall be like the bowls before the altar.

 38:014:021 Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.

 Book 39 Malachi

 39:001:001 The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.

 39:001:002 I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,

 39:001:003 And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.

 39:001:004 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.

 39:001:005 And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.

 39:001:006 A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?

 39:001:007 Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.

 39:001:008 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.

 39:001:009 And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.

 39:001:010 Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.

 39:001:011 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.

 39:001:012 But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.

 39:001:013 Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.

 39:001:014 But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.

 39:002:001 And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.

 39:002:002 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.

 39:002:003 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it.

 39:002:004 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.

 39:002:005 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.

 39:002:006 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.

 39:002:007 For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.

 39:002:008 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.

 39:002:009 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.

 39:002:010 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?

 39:002:011 Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.

 39:002:012 The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts.

 39:002:013 And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth it with good will at your hand.

 39:002:014 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.

 39:002:015 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.

 39:002:016 For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.

 39:002:017 Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?

 39:003:001 Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.

 39:003:002 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:

 39:003:003 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.

 39:003:004 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.

 39:003:005 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.

 39:003:006 For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.

 39:003:007 Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?

 39:003:008 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.

 39:003:009 Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.

 39:003:010 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.

 39:003:011 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.

 39:003:012 And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.

 39:003:013 Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee?

 39:003:014 Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?

 39:003:015 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.

 39:003:016 Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.

 39:003:017 And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.

 39:003:018 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.

 39:004:001 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.

 39:004:002 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.

 39:004:003 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts.

 39:004:004 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments.

 39:004:005 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:

 39:004:006 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.

 Book 40 Matthew

 40:001:001 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

 40:001:002 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;

 40:001:003 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;

 40:001:004 And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;

 40:001:005 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;

 40:001:006 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;

 40:001:007 And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;

 40:001:008 And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;

 40:001:009 And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;

 40:001:010 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;

 40:001:011 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:

 40:001:012 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;

 40:001:013 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;

 40:001:014 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;

 40:001:015 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;

 40:001:016 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.

 40:001:017 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.

 40:001:018 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.

 40:001:019 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.

 40:001:020 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.

 40:001:021 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.

 40:001:022 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,

 40:001:023 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.

 40:001:024 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:

 40:001:025 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.

 40:002:001 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,

 40:002:002 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.

 40:002:003 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

 40:002:004 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.

 40:002:005 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,

 40:002:006 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.

 40:002:007 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.

 40:002:008 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.

 40:002:009 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.

 40:002:010 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

 40:002:011 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.

 40:002:012 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.

 40:002:013 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.

 40:002:014 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:

 40:002:015 And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.

 40:002:016 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.

 40:002:017 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,

 40:002:018 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.

 40:002:019 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,

 40:002:020 Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.

 40:002:021 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.

 40:002:022 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:

 40:002:023 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.

 40:003:001 In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,

 40:003:002 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

 40:003:003 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

 40:003:004 And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.

 40:003:005 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,

 40:003:006 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.

 40:003:007 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

 40:003:008 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:

 40:003:009 And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.

 40:003:010 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

 40:003:011 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:

 40:003:012 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.

 40:003:013 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.

 40:003:014 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?

 40:003:015 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.

 40:003:016 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:

 40:003:017 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

 40:004:001 Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.

 40:004:002 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.

 40:004:003 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.

 40:004:004 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.

 40:004:005 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,

 40:004:006 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.

 40:004:007 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.

 40:004:008 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;

 40:004:009 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.

 40:004:010 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.

 40:004:011 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.

 40:004:012 Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;

 40:004:013 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:

 40:004:014 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,

 40:004:015 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;

 40:004:016 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.

 40:004:017 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

 40:004:018 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.

 40:004:019 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.

 40:004:020 And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.

 40:004:021 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.

 40:004:022 And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.

 40:004:023 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.

 40:004:024 And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.

 40:004:025 And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.

 40:005:001 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:

 40:005:002 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,

 40:005:003 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

 40:005:004 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.

 40:005:005 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.

 40:005:006 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.

 40:005:007 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.

 40:005:008 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.

 40:005:009 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.

 40:005:010 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

 40:005:011 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.

 40:005:012 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

 40:005:013 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.

 40:005:014 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.

 40:005:015 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.

 40:005:016 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

 40:005:017 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.

 40:005:018 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.

 40:005:019 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

 40:005:020 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.

 40:005:021 Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:

 40:005:022 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.

 40:005:023 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;

 40:005:024 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.

 40:005:025 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.

 40:005:026 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.

 40:005:027 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:

 40:005:028 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.

 40:005:029 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.

 40:005:030 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.

 40:005:031 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:

 40:005:032 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.

 40:005:033 Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:

 40:005:034 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:

 40:005:035 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.

 40:005:036 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.

 40:005:037 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.

 40:005:038 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:

 40:005:039 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.

 40:005:040 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.

 40:005:041 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.

 40:005:042 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.

 40:005:043 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.

 40:005:044 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;

 40:005:045 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

 40:005:046 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?

 40:005:047 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?

 40:005:048 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.

 40:006:001 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.

 40:006:002 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

 40:006:003 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:

 40:006:004 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.

 40:006:005 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

 40:006:006 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.

 40:006:007 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.

 40:006:008 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.

 40:006:009 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.

 40:006:010 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.

 40:006:011 Give us this day our daily bread.

 40:006:012 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

 40:006:013 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.

 40:006:014 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:

 40:006:015 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

 40:006:016 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

 40:006:017 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;

 40:006:018 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.

 40:006:019 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:

 40:006:020 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:

 40:006:021 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

 40:006:022 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.

 40:006:023 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!

 40:006:024 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

 40:006:025 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?

 40:006:026 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?

 40:006:027 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?

 40:006:028 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:

 40:006:029 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

 40:006:030 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?

 40:006:031 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?

 40:006:032 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

 40:006:033 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.

 40:006:034 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.

 40:007:001 Judge not, that ye be not judged.

 40:007:002 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

 40:007:003 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

 40:007:004 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

 40:007:005 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.

 40:007:006 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.

 40:007:007 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:

 40:007:008 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

 40:007:009 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?

 40:007:010 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

 40:007:011 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?

 40:007:012 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.

 40:007:013 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:

 40:007:014 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

 40:007:015 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

 40:007:016 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?

 40:007:017 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

 40:007:018 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

 40:007:019 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

 40:007:020 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.

 40:007:021 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.

 40:007:022 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?

 40:007:023 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

 40:007:024 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:

 40:007:025 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.

 40:007:026 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:

 40:007:027 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.

 40:007:028 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:

 40:007:029 For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.

 40:008:001 When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.

 40:008:002 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

 40:008:003 And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

 40:008:004 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.

 40:008:005 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,

 40:008:006 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.

 40:008:007 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.

 40:008:008 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.

 40:008:009 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.

 40:008:010 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.

 40:008:011 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.

 40:008:012 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

 40:008:013 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.

 40:008:014 And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.

 40:008:015 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.

 40:008:016 When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:

 40:008:017 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.

 40:008:018 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.

 40:008:019 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.

 40:008:020 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.

 40:008:021 And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.

 40:008:022 But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.

 40:008:023 And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.

 40:008:024 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.

 40:008:025 And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.

 40:008:026 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.

 40:008:027 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!

 40:008:028 And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.

 40:008:029 And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?

 40:008:030 And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.

 40:008:031 So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.

 40:008:032 And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.

 40:008:033 And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.

 40:008:034 And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.

 40:009:001 And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.

 40:009:002 And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.

 40:009:003 And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.

 40:009:004 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?

 40:009:005 For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?

 40:009:006 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.

 40:009:007 And he arose, and departed to his house.

 40:009:008 But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.

 40:009:009 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.

 40:009:010 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.

 40:009:011 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?

 40:009:012 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.

 40:009:013 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

 40:009:014 Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?

 40:009:015 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.

 40:009:016 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.

 40:009:017 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.

 40:009:018 While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.

 40:009:019 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.

 40:009:020 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:

 40:009:021 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.

 40:009:022 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.

 40:009:023 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,

 40:009:024 He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.

 40:009:025 But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.

 40:009:026 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.

 40:009:027 And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us.

 40:009:028 And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.

 40:009:029 Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.

 40:009:030 And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.

 40:009:031 But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.

 40:009:032 As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.

 40:009:033 And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.

 40:009:034 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.

 40:009:035 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.

 40:009:036 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.

 40:009:037 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;

 40:009:038 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.

 40:010:001 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.

 40:010:002 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;

 40:010:003 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;

 40:010:004 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.

 40:010:005 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:

 40:010:006 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

 40:010:007 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

 40:010:008 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.

 40:010:009 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,

 40:010:010 Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.

 40:010:011 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.

 40:010:012 And when ye come into an house, salute it.

 40:010:013 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.

 40:010:014 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.

 40:010:015 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.

 40:010:016 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

 40:010:017 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;

 40:010:018 And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.

 40:010:019 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.

 40:010:020 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.

 40:010:021 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.

 40:010:022 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.

 40:010:023 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.

 40:010:024 The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.

 40:010:025 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?

 40:010:026 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.

 40:010:027 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.

 40:010:028 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

 40:010:029 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.

 40:010:030 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

 40:010:031 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.

 40:010:032 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.

 40:010:033 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.

 40:010:034 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.

 40:010:035 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.

 40:010:036 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.

 40:010:037 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

 40:010:038 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.

 40:010:039 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.

 40:010:040 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.

 40:010:041 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.

 40:010:042 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.

 40:011:001 And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.

 40:011:002 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,

 40:011:003 And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?

 40:011:004 Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:

 40:011:005 The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.

 40:011:006 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

 40:011:007 And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?

 40:011:008 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.

 40:011:009 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.

 40:011:010 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

 40:011:011 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

 40:011:012 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.

 40:011:013 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.

 40:011:014 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.

 40:011:015 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

 40:011:016 But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,

 40:011:017 And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.

 40:011:018 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.

 40:011:019 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.

 40:011:020 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:

 40:011:021 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

 40:011:022 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.

 40:011:023 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.

 40:011:024 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.

 40:011:025 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.

 40:011:026 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.

 40:011:027 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.

 40:011:028 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

 40:011:029 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

 40:011:030 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

 40:012:001 At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat.

 40:012:002 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.

 40:012:003 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;

 40:012:004 How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?

 40:012:005 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?

 40:012:006 But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.

 40:012:007 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.

 40:012:008 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.

 40:012:009 And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:

 40:012:010 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.

 40:012:011 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?

 40:012:012 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.

 40:012:013 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.

 40:012:014 Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.

 40:012:015 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;

 40:012:016 And charged them that they should not make him known:

 40:012:017 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,

 40:012:018 Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.

 40:012:019 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.

 40:012:020 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.

 40:012:021 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.

 40:012:022 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.

 40:012:023 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?

 40:012:024 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.

 40:012:025 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:

 40:012:026 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?

 40:012:027 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.

 40:012:028 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.

 40:012:029 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.

 40:012:030 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.

 40:012:031 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.

 40:012:032 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.

 40:012:033 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.

 40:012:034 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.

 40:012:035 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.

 40:012:036 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.

 40:012:037 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.

 40:012:038 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.

 40:012:039 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:

 40:012:040 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

 40:012:041 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.

 40:012:042 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

 40:012:043 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.

 40:012:044 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.

 40:012:045 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.

 40:012:046 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.

 40:012:047 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.

 40:012:048 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?

 40:012:049 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!

 40:012:050 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

 40:013:001 The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.

 40:013:002 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.

 40:013:003 And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;

 40:013:004 And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:

 40:013:005 Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:

 40:013:006 And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.

 40:013:007 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:

 40:013:008 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.

 40:013:009 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

 40:013:010 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?

 40:013:011 He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.

 40:013:012 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.

 40:013:013 Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.

 40:013:014 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:

 40:013:015 For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.

 40:013:016 But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.

 40:013:017 For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.

 40:013:018 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.

 40:013:019 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.

 40:013:020 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;

 40:013:021 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.

 40:013:022 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.

 40:013:023 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

 40:013:024 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:

 40:013:025 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.

 40:013:026 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.

 40:013:027 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?

 40:013:028 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?

 40:013:029 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.

 40:013:030 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.

 40:013:031 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:

 40:013:032 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.

 40:013:033 Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

 40:013:034 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:

 40:013:035 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.

 40:013:036 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.

 40:013:037 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;

 40:013:038 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;

 40:013:039 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.

 40:013:040 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.

 40:013:041 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;

 40:013:042 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

 40:013:043 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

 40:013:044 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.

 40:013:045 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:

 40:013:046 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.

 40:013:047 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:

 40:013:048 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.

 40:013:049 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,

 40:013:050 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

 40:013:051 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.

 40:013:052 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.

 40:013:053 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.

 40:013:054 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?

 40:013:055 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?

 40:013:056 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?

 40:013:057 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.

 40:013:058 And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.

 40:014:001 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,

 40:014:002 And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.

 40:014:003 For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.

 40:014:004 For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.

 40:014:005 And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.

 40:014:006 But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.

 40:014:007 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.

 40:014:008 And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.

 40:014:009 And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.

 40:014:010 And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.

 40:014:011 And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.

 40:014:012 And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.

 40:014:013 When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.

 40:014:014 And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.

 40:014:015 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.

 40:014:016 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.

 40:014:017 And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.

 40:014:018 He said, Bring them hither to me.

 40:014:019 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

 40:014:020 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.

 40:014:021 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.

 40:014:022 And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.

 40:014:023 And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.

 40:014:024 But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.

 40:014:025 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.

 40:014:026 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.

 40:014:027 But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.

 40:014:028 And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.

 40:014:029 And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.

 40:014:030 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.

 40:014:031 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?

 40:014:032 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.

 40:014:033 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.

 40:014:034 And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.

 40:014:035 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;

 40:014:036 And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.

 40:015:001 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,

 40:015:002 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.

 40:015:003 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?

 40:015:004 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.

 40:015:005 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;

 40:015:006 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.

 40:015:007 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,

 40:015:008 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.

 40:015:009 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.

 40:015:010 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:

 40:015:011 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.

 40:015:012 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?

 40:015:013 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.

 40:015:014 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

 40:015:015 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.

 40:015:016 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?

 40:015:017 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?

 40:015:018 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.

 40:015:019 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:

 40:015:020 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.

 40:015:021 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.

 40:015:022 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.

 40:015:023 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.

 40:015:024 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

 40:015:025 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.

 40:015:026 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.

 40:015:027 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.

 40:015:028 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.

 40:015:029 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.

 40:015:030 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:

 40:015:031 Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.

 40:015:032 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.

 40:015:033 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?

 40:015:034 And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.

 40:015:035 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.

 40:015:036 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

 40:015:037 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.

 40:015:038 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.

 40:015:039 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.

 40:016:001 The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.

 40:016:002 He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.

 40:016:003 And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?

 40:016:004 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.

 40:016:005 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.

 40:016:006 Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

 40:016:007 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.

 40:016:008 Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?

 40:016:009 Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?

 40:016:010 Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?

 40:016:011 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?

 40:016:012 Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

 40:016:013 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?

 40:016:014 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.

 40:016:015 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?

 40:016:016 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

 40:016:017 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.

 40:016:018 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

 40:016:019 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

 40:016:020 Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.

 40:016:021 From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.

 40:016:022 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.

 40:016:023 But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.

 40:016:024 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

 40:016:025 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.

 40:016:026 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

 40:016:027 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.

 40:016:028 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.

 40:017:001 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,

 40:017:002 And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.

 40:017:003 And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.

 40:017:004 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.

 40:017:005 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.

 40:017:006 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.

 40:017:007 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.

 40:017:008 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.

 40:017:009 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.

 40:017:010 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?

 40:017:011 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.

 40:017:012 But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.

 40:017:013 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.

 40:017:014 And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,

 40:017:015 Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.

 40:017:016 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.

 40:017:017 Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.

 40:017:018 And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.

 40:017:019 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?

 40:017:020 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.

 40:017:021 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.

 40:017:022 And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:

 40:017:023 And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.

 40:017:024 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?

 40:017:025 He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?

 40:017:026 Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.

 40:017:027 Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.

 40:018:001 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?

 40:018:002 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,

 40:018:003 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.

 40:018:004 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

 40:018:005 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.

 40:018:006 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.

 40:018:007 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!

 40:018:008 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.

 40:018:009 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.

 40:018:010 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.

 40:018:011 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.

 40:018:012 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?

 40:018:013 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.

 40:018:014 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.

 40:018:015 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.

 40:018:016 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.

 40:018:017 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.

 40:018:018 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

 40:018:019 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.

 40:018:020 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.

 40:018:021 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?

 40:018:022 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.

 40:018:023 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.

 40:018:024 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.

 40:018:025 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.

 40:018:026 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

 40:018:027 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.

 40:018:028 But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.

 40:018:029 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

 40:018:030 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.

 40:018:031 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.

 40:018:032 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:

 40:018:033 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?

 40:018:034 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.

 40:018:035 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.

 40:019:001 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;

 40:019:002 And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.

 40:019:003 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?

 40:019:004 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,

 40:019:005 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?

 40:019:006 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

 40:019:007 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?

 40:019:008 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.

 40:019:009 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.

 40:019:010 His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.

 40:019:011 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.

 40:019:012 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.

 40:019:013 Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.

 40:019:014 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.

 40:019:015 And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.

 40:019:016 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?

 40:019:017 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.

 40:019:018 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,

 40:019:019 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

 40:019:020 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?

 40:019:021 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.

 40:019:022 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.

 40:019:023 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.

 40:019:024 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

 40:019:025 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?

 40:019:026 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.

 40:019:027 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?

 40:019:028 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

 40:019:029 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.

 40:019:030 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.

 40:020:001 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.

 40:020:002 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.

 40:020:003 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,

 40:020:004 And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.

 40:020:005 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.

 40:020:006 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?

 40:020:007 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.

 40:020:008 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.

 40:020:009 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.

 40:020:010 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.

 40:020:011 And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,

 40:020:012 Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.

 40:020:013 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?

 40:020:014 Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.

 40:020:015 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?

 40:020:016 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.

 40:020:017 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,

 40:020:018 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,

 40:020:019 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.

 40:020:020 Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.

 40:020:021 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.

 40:020:022 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.

 40:020:023 And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.

 40:020:024 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.

 40:020:025 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.

 40:020:026 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;

 40:020:027 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:

 40:020:028 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

 40:020:029 And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.

 40:020:030 And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.

 40:020:031 And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.

 40:020:032 And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?

 40:020:033 They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.

 40:020:034 So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.

 40:021:001 And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,

 40:021:002 Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me.

 40:021:003 And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.

 40:021:004 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,

 40:021:005 Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.

 40:021:006 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,

 40:021:007 And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.

 40:021:008 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.

 40:021:009 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.

 40:021:010 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?

 40:021:011 And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.

 40:021:012 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,

 40:021:013 And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.

 40:021:014 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.

 40:021:015 And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,

 40:021:016 And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?

 40:021:017 And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.

 40:021:018 Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.

 40:021:019 And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.

 40:021:020 And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!

 40:021:021 Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.

 40:021:022 And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.

 40:021:023 And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?

 40:021:024 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.

 40:021:025 The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?

 40:021:026 But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.

 40:021:027 And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.

 40:021:028 But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.

 40:021:029 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.

 40:021:030 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.

 40:021:031 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.

 40:021:032 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.

 40:021:033 Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:

 40:021:034 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.

 40:021:035 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.

 40:021:036 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.

 40:021:037 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.

 40:021:038 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.

 40:021:039 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.

 40:021:040 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?

 40:021:041 They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.

 40:021:042 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?

 40:021:043 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.

 40:021:044 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

 40:021:045 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.

 40:021:046 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.

 40:022:001 And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,

 40:022:002 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,

 40:022:003 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.

 40:022:004 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.

 40:022:005 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:

 40:022:006 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.

 40:022:007 But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.

 40:022:008 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.

 40:022:009 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.

 40:022:010 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.

 40:022:011 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:

 40:022:012 And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.

 40:022:013 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

 40:022:014 For many are called, but few are chosen.

 40:022:015 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.

 40:022:016 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.

 40:022:017 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?

 40:022:018 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?

 40:022:019 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.

 40:022:020 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?

 40:022:021 They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.

 40:022:022 When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.

 40:022:023 The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,

 40:022:024 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

 40:022:025 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:

 40:022:026 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.

 40:022:027 And last of all the woman died also.

 40:022:028 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.

 40:022:029 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.

 40:022:030 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.

 40:022:031 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,

 40:022:032 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

 40:022:033 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.

 40:022:034 But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.

 40:022:035 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,

 40:022:036 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?

 40:022:037 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

 40:022:038 This is the first and great commandment.

 40:022:039 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

 40:022:040 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

 40:022:041 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,

 40:022:042 Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David.

 40:022:043 He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,

 40:022:044 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?

 40:022:045 If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?

 40:022:046 And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.

 40:023:001 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,

 40:023:002 Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:

 40:023:003 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.

 40:023:004 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.

 40:023:005 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,

 40:023:006 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,

 40:023:007 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.

 40:023:008 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.

 40:023:009 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.

 40:023:010 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.

 40:023:011 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.

 40:023:012 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.

 40:023:013 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.

 40:023:014 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.

 40:023:015 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.

 40:023:016 Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!

 40:023:017 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?

 40:023:018 And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.

 40:023:019 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?

 40:023:020 Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.

 40:023:021 And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.

 40:023:022 And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.

 40:023:023 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.

 40:023:024 Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.

 40:023:025 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.

 40:023:026 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.

 40:023:027 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.

 40:023:028 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

 40:023:029 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,

 40:023:030 And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.

 40:023:031 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.

 40:023:032 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.

 40:023:033 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?

 40:023:034 Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:

 40:023:035 That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.

 40:023:036 Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.

 40:023:037 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!

 40:023:038 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.

 40:023:039 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

 40:024:001 And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.

 40:024:002 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.

 40:024:003 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?

 40:024:004 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.

 40:024:005 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.

 40:024:006 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.

 40:024:007 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.

 40:024:008 All these are the beginning of sorrows.

 40:024:009 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.

 40:024:010 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.

 40:024:011 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.

 40:024:012 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.

 40:024:013 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.

 40:024:014 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.

 40:024:015 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)

 40:024:016 Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:

 40:024:017 Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:

 40:024:018 Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.

 40:024:019 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!

 40:024:020 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:

 40:024:021 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.

 40:024:022 And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.

 40:024:023 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.

 40:024:024 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.

 40:024:025 Behold, I have told you before.

 40:024:026 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.

 40:024:027 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

 40:024:028 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.

 40:024:029 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:

 40:024:030 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.

 40:024:031 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.

 40:024:032 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:

 40:024:033 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.

 40:024:034 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.

 40:024:035 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.

 40:024:036 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.

 40:024:037 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

 40:024:038 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,

 40:024:039 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

 40:024:040 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.

 40:024:041 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.

 40:024:042 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.

 40:024:043 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.

 40:024:044 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.

 40:024:045 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?

 40:024:046 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.

 40:024:047 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.

 40:024:048 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;

 40:024:049 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;

 40:024:050 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,

 40:024:051 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

 40:025:001 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

 40:025:002 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.

 40:025:003 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:

 40:025:004 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

 40:025:005 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.

 40:025:006 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.

 40:025:007 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

 40:025:008 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.

 40:025:009 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.

 40:025:010 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.

 40:025:011 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.

 40:025:012 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.

 40:025:013 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.

 40:025:014 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.

 40:025:015 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.

 40:025:016 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.

 40:025:017 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.

 40:025:018 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.

 40:025:019 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.

 40:025:020 And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.

 40:025:021 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

 40:025:022 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.

 40:025:023 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

 40:025:024 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:

 40:025:025 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.

 40:025:026 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:

 40:025:027 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.

 40:025:028 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.

 40:025:029 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.

 40:025:030 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

 40:025:031 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:

 40:025:032 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:

 40:025:033 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.

 40:025:034 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:

 40:025:035 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:

 40:025:036 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.

 40:025:037 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?

 40:025:038 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?

 40:025:039 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?

 40:025:040 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.

 40:025:041 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:

 40:025:042 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:

 40:025:043 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

 40:025:044 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?

 40:025:045 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.

 40:025:046 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

 40:026:001 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,

 40:026:002 Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.

 40:026:003 Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,

 40:026:004 And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.

 40:026:005 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.

 40:026:006 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,

 40:026:007 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.

 40:026:008 But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?

 40:026:009 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.

 40:026:010 When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.

 40:026:011 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.

 40:026:012 For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.

 40:026:013 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.

 40:026:014 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,

 40:026:015 And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.

 40:026:016 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.

 40:026:017 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?

 40:026:018 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.

 40:026:019 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.

 40:026:020 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.

 40:026:021 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.

 40:026:022 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?

 40:026:023 And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.

 40:026:024 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.

 40:026:025 Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.

 40:026:026 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.

 40:026:027 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;

 40:026:028 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.

 40:026:029 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.

 40:026:030 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.

 40:026:031 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.

 40:026:032 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.

 40:026:033 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.

 40:026:034 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.

 40:026:035 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.

 40:026:036 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.

 40:026:037 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.

 40:026:038 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.

 40:026:039 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.

 40:026:040 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?

 40:026:041 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

 40:026:042 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.

 40:026:043 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.

 40:026:044 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.

 40:026:045 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

 40:026:046 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.

 40:026:047 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.

 40:026:048 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.

 40:026:049 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.

 40:026:050 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.

 40:026:051 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.

 40:026:052 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.

 40:026:053 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?

 40:026:054 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?

 40:026:055 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.

 40:026:056 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.

 40:026:057 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.

 40:026:058 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.

 40:026:059 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;

 40:026:060 But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,

 40:026:061 And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.

 40:026:062 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?

 40:026:063 But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.

 40:026:064 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

 40:026:065 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.

 40:026:066 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.

 40:026:067 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,

 40:026:068 Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?

 40:026:069 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.

 40:026:070 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.

 40:026:071 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.

 40:026:072 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.

 40:026:073 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.

 40:026:074 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.

 40:026:075 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.

 40:027:001 When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:

 40:027:002 And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.

 40:027:003 Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,

 40:027:004 Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.

 40:027:005 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.

 40:027:006 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.

 40:027:007 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.

 40:027:008 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.

 40:027:009 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;

 40:027:010 And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.

 40:027:011 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.

 40:027:012 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.

 40:027:013 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?

 40:027:014 And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.

 40:027:015 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.

 40:027:016 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.

 40:027:017 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?

 40:027:018 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.

 40:027:019 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.

 40:027:020 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.

 40:027:021 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.

 40:027:022 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.

 40:027:023 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.

 40:027:024 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.

 40:027:025 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.

 40:027:026 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.

 40:027:027 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.

 40:027:028 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.

 40:027:029 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!

 40:027:030 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.

 40:027:031 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.

 40:027:032 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.

 40:027:033 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,

 40:027:034 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.

 40:027:035 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.

 40:027:036 And sitting down they watched him there;

 40:027:037 And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

 40:027:038 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.

 40:027:039 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,

 40:027:040 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.

 40:027:041 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,

 40:027:042 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.

 40:027:043 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.

 40:027:044 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.

 40:027:045 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.

 40:027:046 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

 40:027:047 Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.

 40:027:048 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.

 40:027:049 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.

 40:027:050 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.

 40:027:051 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;

 40:027:052 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,

 40:027:053 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.

 40:027:054 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

 40:027:055 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:

 40:027:056 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.

 40:027:057 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:

 40:027:058 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.

 40:027:059 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,

 40:027:060 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.

 40:027:061 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.

 40:027:062 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,

 40:027:063 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.

 40:027:064 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.

 40:027:065 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.

 40:027:066 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.

 40:028:001 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.

 40:028:002 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.

 40:028:003 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:

 40:028:004 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.

 40:028:005 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.

 40:028:006 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.

 40:028:007 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.

 40:028:008 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.

 40:028:009 And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.

 40:028:010 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.

 40:028:011 Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.

 40:028:012 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,

 40:028:013 Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.

 40:028:014 And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.

 40:028:015 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.

 40:028:016 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.

 40:028:017 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.

 40:028:018 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

 40:028:019 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

 40:028:020 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

 Book 41 Mark

 41:001:001 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;

 41:001:002 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

 41:001:003 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

 41:001:004 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.

 41:001:005 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.

 41:001:006 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;

 41:001:007 And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.

 41:001:008 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.

 41:001:009 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.

 41:001:010 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:

 41:001:011 And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

 41:001:012 And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.

 41:001:013 And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.

 41:001:014 Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,

 41:001:015 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

 41:001:016 Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.

 41:001:017 And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.

 41:001:018 And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.

 41:001:019 And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.

 41:001:020 And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.

 41:001:021 And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.

 41:001:022 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.

 41:001:023 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,

 41:001:024 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.

 41:001:025 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.

 41:001:026 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.

 41:001:027 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.

 41:001:028 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.

 41:001:029 And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

 41:001:030 But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.

 41:001:031 And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.

 41:001:032 And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.

 41:001:033 And all the city was gathered together at the door.

 41:001:034 And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.

 41:001:035 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.

 41:001:036 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.

 41:001:037 And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.

 41:001:038 And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.

 41:001:039 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.

 41:001:040 And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

 41:001:041 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.

 41:001:042 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.

 41:001:043 And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;

 41:001:044 And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.

 41:001:045 But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.

 41:002:001 And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.

 41:002:002 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.

 41:002:003 And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.

 41:002:004 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.

 41:002:005 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.

 41:002:006 But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,

 41:002:007 Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?

 41:002:008 And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?

 41:002:009 Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?

 41:002:010 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)

 41:002:011 I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.

 41:002:012 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.

 41:002:013 And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.

 41:002:014 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.

 41:002:015 And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.

 41:002:016 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?

 41:002:017 When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

 41:002:018 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?

 41:002:019 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.

 41:002:020 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.

 41:002:021 No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.

 41:002:022 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.

 41:002:023 And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.

 41:002:024 And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?

 41:002:025 And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?

 41:002:026 How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?

 41:002:027 And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:

 41:002:028 Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

 41:003:001 And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.

 41:003:002 And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.

 41:003:003 And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.

 41:003:004 And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.

 41:003:005 And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.

 41:003:006 And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.

 41:003:007 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,

 41:003:008 And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.

 41:003:009 And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.

 41:003:010 For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.

 41:003:011 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.

 41:003:012 And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.

 41:003:013 And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.

 41:003:014 And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,

 41:003:015 And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:

 41:003:016 And Simon he surnamed Peter;

 41:003:017 And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:

 41:003:018 And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,

 41:003:019 And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.

 41:003:020 And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.

 41:003:021 And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.

 41:003:022 And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.

 41:003:023 And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?

 41:003:024 And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.

 41:003:025 And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.

 41:003:026 And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.

 41:003:027 No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.

 41:003:028 Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:

 41:003:029 But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.

 41:003:030 Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.

 41:003:031 There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.

 41:003:032 And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.

 41:003:033 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?

 41:003:034 And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!

 41:003:035 For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.

 41:004:001 And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.

 41:004:002 And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,

 41:004:003 Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:

 41:004:004 And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.

 41:004:005 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:

 41:004:006 But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.

 41:004:007 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.

 41:004:008 And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.

 41:004:009 And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

 41:004:010 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.

 41:004:011 And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:

 41:004:012 That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.

 41:004:013 And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?

 41:004:014 The sower soweth the word.

 41:004:015 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.

 41:004:016 And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;

 41:004:017 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.

 41:004:018 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,

 41:004:019 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.

 41:004:020 And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.

 41:004:021 And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?

 41:004:022 For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.

 41:004:023 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

 41:004:024 And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.

 41:004:025 For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.

 41:004:026 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;

 41:004:027 And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.

 41:004:028 For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.

 41:004:029 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.

 41:004:030 And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?

 41:004:031 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:

 41:004:032 But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.

 41:004:033 And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.

 41:004:034 But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.

 41:004:035 And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.

 41:004:036 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.

 41:004:037 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.

 41:004:038 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?

 41:004:039 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.

 41:004:040 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?

 41:004:041 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?

 41:005:001 And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.

 41:005:002 And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,

 41:005:003 Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:

 41:005:004 Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.

 41:005:005 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.

 41:005:006 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,

 41:005:007 And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.

 41:005:008 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.

 41:005:009 And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.

 41:005:010 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.

 41:005:011 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.

 41:005:012 And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.

 41:005:013 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.

 41:005:014 And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.

 41:005:015 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.

 41:005:016 And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.

 41:005:017 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.

 41:005:018 And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.

 41:005:019 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.

 41:005:020 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.

 41:005:021 And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.

 41:005:022 And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,

 41:005:023 And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.

 41:005:024 And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.

 41:005:025 And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,

 41:005:026 And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,

 41:005:027 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.

 41:005:028 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.

 41:005:029 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.

 41:005:030 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?

 41:005:031 And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

 41:005:032 And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.

 41:005:033 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.

 41:005:034 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.

 41:005:035 While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?

 41:005:036 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.

 41:005:037 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.

 41:005:038 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.

 41:005:039 And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.

 41:005:040 And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.

 41:005:041 And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.

 41:005:042 And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.

 41:005:043 And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.

 41:006:001 And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.

 41:006:002 And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?

 41:006:003 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.

 41:006:004 But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.

 41:006:005 And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.

 41:006:006 And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.

 41:006:007 And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;

 41:006:008 And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:

 41:006:009 But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.

 41:006:010 And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.

 41:006:011 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.

 41:006:012 And they went out, and preached that men should repent.

 41:006:013 And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.

 41:006:014 And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.

 41:006:015 Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.

 41:006:016 But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.

 41:006:017 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.

 41:006:018 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.

 41:006:019 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:

 41:006:020 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.

 41:006:021 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;

 41:006:022 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.

 41:006:023 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.

 41:006:024 And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.

 41:006:025 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.

 41:006:026 And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.

 41:006:027 And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,

 41:006:028 And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.

 41:006:029 And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.

 41:006:030 And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.

 41:006:031 And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.

 41:006:032 And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.

 41:006:033 And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.

 41:006:034 And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.

 41:006:035 And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:

 41:006:036 Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.

 41:006:037 He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?

 41:006:038 He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.

 41:006:039 And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.

 41:006:040 And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.

 41:006:041 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.

 41:006:042 And they did all eat, and were filled.

 41:006:043 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.

 41:006:044 And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.

 41:006:045 And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.

 41:006:046 And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.

 41:006:047 And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.

 41:006:048 And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.

 41:006:049 But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:

 41:006:050 For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.

 41:006:051 And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.

 41:006:052 For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.

 41:006:053 And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.

 41:006:054 And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,

 41:006:055 And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.

 41:006:056 And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.

 41:007:001 Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.

 41:007:002 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.

 41:007:003 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.

 41:007:004 And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.

 41:007:005 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?

 41:007:006 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.

 41:007:007 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.

 41:007:008 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.

 41:007:009 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.

 41:007:010 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:

 41:007:011 But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.

 41:007:012 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;

 41:007:013 Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.

 41:007:014 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:

 41:007:015 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.

 41:007:016 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

 41:007:017 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.

 41:007:018 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;

 41:007:019 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?

 41:007:020 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.

 41:007:021 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,

 41:007:022 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:

 41:007:023 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.

 41:007:024 And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.

 41:007:025 For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:

 41:007:026 The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.

 41:007:027 But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.

 41:007:028 And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.

 41:007:029 And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.

 41:007:030 And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.

 41:007:031 And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.

 41:007:032 And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.

 41:007:033 And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;

 41:007:034 And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.

 41:007:035 And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.

 41:007:036 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;

 41:007:037 And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.

 41:008:001 In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,

 41:008:002 I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:

 41:008:003 And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.

 41:008:004 And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?

 41:008:005 And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.

 41:008:006 And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.

 41:008:007 And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.

 41:008:008 So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.

 41:008:009 And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.

 41:008:010 And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.

 41:008:011 And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.

 41:008:012 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.

 41:008:013 And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.

 41:008:014 Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.

 41:008:015 And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.

 41:008:016 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.

 41:008:017 And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?

 41:008:018 Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?

 41:008:019 When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.

 41:008:020 And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.

 41:008:021 And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?

 41:008:022 And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.

 41:008:023 And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.

 41:008:024 And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.

 41:008:025 After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.

 41:008:026 And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.

 41:008:027 And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?

 41:008:028 And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.

 41:008:029 And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.

 41:008:030 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.

 41:008:031 And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.

 41:008:032 And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.

 41:008:033 But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.

 41:008:034 And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

 41:008:035 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.

 41:008:036 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?

 41:008:037 Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

 41:008:038 Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.

 41:009:001 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.

 41:009:002 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.

 41:009:003 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.

 41:009:004 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.

 41:009:005 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.

 41:009:006 For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.

 41:009:007 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.

 41:009:008 And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.

 41:009:009 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.

 41:009:010 And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.

 41:009:011 And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?

 41:009:012 And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.

 41:009:013 But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.

 41:009:014 And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.

 41:009:015 And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.

 41:009:016 And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?

 41:009:017 And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;

 41:009:018 And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.

 41:009:019 He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.

 41:009:020 And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.

 41:009:021 And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.

 41:009:022 And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.

 41:009:023 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.

 41:009:024 And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.

 41:009:025 When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.

 41:009:026 And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.

 41:009:027 But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.

 41:009:028 And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?

 41:009:029 And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.

 41:009:030 And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.

 41:009:031 For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.

 41:009:032 But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.

 41:009:033 And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?

 41:009:034 But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.

 41:009:035 And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.

 41:009:036 And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,

 41:009:037 Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.

 41:009:038 And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.

 41:009:039 But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.

 41:009:040 For he that is not against us is on our part.

 41:009:041 For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.

 41:009:042 And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.

 41:009:043 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:

 41:009:044 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

 41:009:045 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:

 41:009:046 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

 41:009:047 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:

 41:009:048 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

 41:009:049 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.

 41:009:050 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.

 41:010:001 And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.

 41:010:002 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.

 41:010:003 And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?

 41:010:004 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.

 41:010:005 And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.

 41:010:006 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.

 41:010:007 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;

 41:010:008 And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.

 41:010:009 What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

 41:010:010 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.

 41:010:011 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.

 41:010:012 And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.

 41:010:013 And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.

 41:010:014 But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.

 41:010:015 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.

 41:010:016 And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.

 41:010:017 And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?

 41:010:018 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.

 41:010:019 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.

 41:010:020 And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.

 41:010:021 Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.

 41:010:022 And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.

 41:010:023 And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!

 41:010:024 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!

 41:010:025 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

 41:010:026 And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?

 41:010:027 And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.

 41:010:028 Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.

 41:010:029 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,

 41:010:030 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.

 41:010:031 But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.

 41:010:032 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,

 41:010:033 Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:

 41:010:034 And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.

 41:010:035 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.

 41:010:036 And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?

 41:010:037 They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.

 41:010:038 But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?

 41:010:039 And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:

 41:010:040 But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.

 41:010:041 And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.

 41:010:042 But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.

 41:010:043 But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:

 41:010:044 And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.

 41:010:045 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

 41:010:046 And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.

 41:010:047 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.

 41:010:048 And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.

 41:010:049 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.

 41:010:050 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.

 41:010:051 And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.

 41:010:052 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.

 41:011:001 And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,

 41:011:002 And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.

 41:011:003 And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.

 41:011:004 And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.

 41:011:005 And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?

 41:011:006 And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.

 41:011:007 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.

 41:011:008 And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.

 41:011:009 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:

 41:011:010 Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.

 41:011:011 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.

 41:011:012 And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:

 41:011:013 And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.

 41:011:014 And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.

 41:011:015 And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;

 41:011:016 And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.

 41:011:017 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.

 41:011:018 And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.

 41:011:019 And when even was come, he went out of the city.

 41:011:020 And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.

 41:011:021 And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.

 41:011:022 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.

 41:011:023 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.

 41:011:024 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.

 41:011:025 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.

 41:011:026 But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.

 41:011:027 And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,

 41:011:028 And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?

 41:011:029 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.

 41:011:030 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.

 41:011:031 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?

 41:011:032 But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.

 41:011:033 And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

 41:012:001 And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.

 41:012:002 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.

 41:012:003 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.

 41:012:004 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.

 41:012:005 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.

 41:012:006 Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.

 41:012:007 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.

 41:012:008 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.

 41:012:009 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.

 41:012:010 And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:

 41:012:011 This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?

 41:012:012 And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.

 41:012:013 And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.

 41:012:014 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?

 41:012:015 Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.

 41:012:016 And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.

 41:012:017 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.

 41:012:018 Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,

 41:012:019 Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

 41:012:020 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.

 41:012:021 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.

 41:012:022 And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.

 41:012:023 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.

 41:012:024 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?

 41:012:025 For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.

 41:012:026 And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?

 41:012:027 He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.

 41:012:028 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?

 41:012:029 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:

 41:012:030 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.

 41:012:031 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.

 41:012:032 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:

 41:012:033 And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.

 41:012:034 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.

 41:012:035 And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?

 41:012:036 For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.

 41:012:037 David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.

 41:012:038 And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,

 41:012:039 And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:

 41:012:040 Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.

 41:012:041 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.

 41:012:042 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.

 41:012:043 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:

 41:012:044 For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.

 41:013:001 And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!

 41:013:002 And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.

 41:013:003 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,

 41:013:004 Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?

 41:013:005 And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:

 41:013:006 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.

 41:013:007 And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.

 41:013:008 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.

 41:013:009 But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.

 41:013:010 And the gospel must first be published among all nations.

 41:013:011 But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.

 41:013:012 Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.

 41:013:013 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.

 41:013:014 But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:

 41:013:015 And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:

 41:013:016 And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.

 41:013:017 But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!

 41:013:018 And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.

 41:013:019 For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.

 41:013:020 And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.

 41:013:021 And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:

 41:013:022 For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.

 41:013:023 But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.

 41:013:024 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,

 41:013:025 And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.

 41:013:026 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.

 41:013:027 And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.

 41:013:028 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:

 41:013:029 So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.

 41:013:030 Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.

 41:013:031 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.

 41:013:032 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.

 41:013:033 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.

 41:013:034 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.

 41:013:035 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:

 41:013:036 Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.

 41:013:037 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.

 41:014:001 After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.

 41:014:002 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.

 41:014:003 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head.

 41:014:004 And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?

 41:014:005 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.

 41:014:006 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.

 41:014:007 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.

 41:014:008 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.

 41:014:009 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.

 41:014:010 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.

 41:014:011 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.

 41:014:012 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?

 41:014:013 And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.

 41:014:014 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?

 41:014:015 And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.

 41:014:016 And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.

 41:014:017 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.

 41:014:018 And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.

 41:014:019 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?

 41:014:020 And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.

 41:014:021 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.

 41:014:022 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.

 41:014:023 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.

 41:014:024 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.

 41:014:025 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.

 41:014:026 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.

 41:014:027 And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.

 41:014:028 But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.

 41:014:029 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.

 41:014:030 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.

 41:014:031 But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.

 41:014:032 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.

 41:014:033 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;

 41:014:034 And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.

 41:014:035 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.

 41:014:036 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.

 41:014:037 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?

 41:014:038 Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.

 41:014:039 And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.

 41:014:040 And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.

 41:014:041 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

 41:014:042 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.

 41:014:043 And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.

 41:014:044 And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.

 41:014:045 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.

 41:014:046 And they laid their hands on him, and took him.

 41:014:047 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

 41:014:048 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?

 41:014:049 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.

 41:014:050 And they all forsook him, and fled.

 41:014:051 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:

 41:014:052 And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.

 41:014:053 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.

 41:014:054 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.

 41:014:055 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.

 41:014:056 For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.

 41:014:057 And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,

 41:014:058 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.

 41:014:059 But neither so did their witness agree together.

 41:014:060 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?

 41:014:061 But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?

 41:014:062 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

 41:014:063 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?

 41:014:064 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.

 41:014:065 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.

 41:014:066 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:

 41:014:067 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.

 41:014:068 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.

 41:014:069 And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.

 41:014:070 And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.

 41:014:071 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.

 41:014:072 And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.

 41:015:001 And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.

 41:015:002 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.

 41:015:003 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.

 41:015:004 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.

 41:015:005 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.

 41:015:006 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.

 41:015:007 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.

 41:015:008 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.

 41:015:009 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?

 41:015:010 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.

 41:015:011 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.

 41:015:012 And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?

 41:015:013 And they cried out again, Crucify him.

 41:015:014 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.

 41:015:015 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.

 41:015:016 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.

 41:015:017 And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,

 41:015:018 And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!

 41:015:019 And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.

 41:015:020 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.

 41:015:021 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.

 41:015:022 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.

 41:015:023 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.

 41:015:024 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.

 41:015:025 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.

 41:015:026 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

 41:015:027 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.

 41:015:028 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.

 41:015:029 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,

 41:015:030 Save thyself, and come down from the cross.

 41:015:031 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.

 41:015:032 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.

 41:015:033 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.

 41:015:034 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

 41:015:035 And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.

 41:015:036 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.

 41:015:037 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.

 41:015:038 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.

 41:015:039 And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.

 41:015:040 There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;

 41:015:041 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.

 41:015:042 And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,

 41:015:043 Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.

 41:015:044 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.

 41:015:045 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.

 41:015:046 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.

 41:015:047 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.

 41:016:001 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.

 41:016:002 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.

 41:016:003 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?

 41:016:004 And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.

 41:016:005 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.

 41:016:006 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.

 41:016:007 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.

 41:016:008 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.

 41:016:009 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.

 41:016:010 And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.

 41:016:011 And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.

 41:016:012 After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.

 41:016:013 And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.

 41:016:014 Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.

 41:016:015 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.

 41:016:016 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.

 41:016:017 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;

 41:016:018 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.

 41:016:019 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.

 41:016:020 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.

 Book 42 Luke

 42:001:001 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,

 42:001:002 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;

 42:001:003 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,

 42:001:004 That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.

 42:001:005 THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.

 42:001:006 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

 42:001:007 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.

 42:001:008 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,

 42:001:009 According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.

 42:001:010 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.

 42:001:011 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.

 42:001:012 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.

 42:001:013 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.

 42:001:014 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.

 42:001:015 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.

 42:001:016 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.

 42:001:017 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.

 42:001:018 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.

 42:001:019 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.

 42:001:020 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.

 42:001:021 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.

 42:001:022 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.

 42:001:023 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.

 42:001:024 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,

 42:001:025 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.

 42:001:026 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,

 42:001:027 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.

 42:001:028 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.

 42:001:029 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.

 42:001:030 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.

 42:001:031 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.

 42:001:032 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:

 42:001:033 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.

 42:001:034 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?

 42:001:035 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.

 42:001:036 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.

 42:001:037 For with God nothing shall be impossible.

 42:001:038 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

 42:001:039 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;

 42:001:040 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.

 42:001:041 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:

 42:001:042 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

 42:001:043 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

 42:001:044 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

 42:001:045 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.

 42:001:046 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,

 42:001:047 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.

 42:001:048 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.

 42:001:049 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.

 42:001:050 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.

 42:001:051 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.

 42:001:052 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.

 42:001:053 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.

 42:001:054 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;

 42:001:055 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.

 42:001:056 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.

 42:001:057 Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.

 42:001:058 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.

 42:001:059 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.

 42:001:060 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.

 42:001:061 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.

 42:001:062 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.

 42:001:063 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.

 42:001:064 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God.

 42:001:065 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.

 42:001:066 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.

 42:001:067 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,

 42:001:068 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,

 42:001:069 And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;

 42:001:070 As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:

 42:001:071 That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;

 42:001:072 To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;

 42:001:073 The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,

 42:001:074 That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,

 42:001:075 In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.

 42:001:076 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;

 42:001:077 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,

 42:001:078 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,

 42:001:079 To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.

 42:001:080 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.

 42:002:001 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.

 42:002:002 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)

 42:002:003 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.

 42:002:004 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)

 42:002:005 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.

 42:002:006 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.

 42:002:007 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.

 42:002:008 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.

 42:002:009 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.

 42:002:010 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.

 42:002:011 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.

 42:002:012 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.

 42:002:013 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,

 42:002:014 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.

 42:002:015 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.

 42:002:016 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.

 42:002:017 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.

 42:002:018 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.

 42:002:019 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.

 42:002:020 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.

 42:002:021 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.

 42:002:022 And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;

 42:002:023 (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)

 42:002:024 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.

 42:002:025 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.

 42:002:026 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.

 42:002:027 And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,

 42:002:028 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,

 42:002:029 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:

 42:002:030 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,

 42:002:031 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;

 42:002:032 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.

 42:002:033 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.

 42:002:034 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;

 42:002:035 (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.

 42:002:036 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;

 42:002:037 And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.

 42:002:038 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.

 42:002:039 And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.

 42:002:040 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.

 42:002:041 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.

 42:002:042 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.

 42:002:043 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.

 42:002:044 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.

 42:002:045 And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.

 42:002:046 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.

 42:002:047 And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.

 42:002:048 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.

 42:002:049 And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?

 42:002:050 And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.

 42:002:051 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.

 42:002:052 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.

 42:003:001 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,

 42:003:002 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

 42:003:003 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;

 42:003:004 As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

 42:003:005 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;

 42:003:006 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.

 42:003:007 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

 42:003:008 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.

 42:003:009 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

 42:003:010 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?

 42:003:011 He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.

 42:003:012 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?

 42:003:013 And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.

 42:003:014 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.

 42:003:015 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;

 42:003:016 John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:

 42:003:017 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.

 42:003:018 And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people.

 42:003:019 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,

 42:003:020 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.

 42:003:021 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,

 42:003:022 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.

 42:003:023 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,

 42:003:024 Which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Janna, which was the son of Joseph,

 42:003:025 Which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Amos, which was the son of Naum, which was the son of Esli, which was the son of Nagge,

 42:003:026 Which was the son of Maath, which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Semei, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Juda,

 42:003:027 Which was the son of Joanna, which was the son of Rhesa, which was the son of Zorobabel, which was the son of Salathiel, which was the son of Neri,

 42:003:028 Which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Addi, which was the son of Cosam, which was the son of Elmodam, which was the son of Er,

 42:003:029 Which was the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which was the son of Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi,

 42:003:030 Which was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Juda, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was the son of Eliakim,

 42:003:031 Which was the son of Melea, which was the son of Menan, which was the son of Mattatha, which was the son of Nathan, which was the son of David,

 42:003:032 Which was the son of Jesse, which was the son of Obed, which was the son of Booz, which was the son of Salmon, which was the son of Naasson,

 42:003:033 Which was the son of Aminadab, which was the son of Aram, which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of Phares, which was the son of Juda,

 42:003:034 Which was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Isaac, which was the son of Abraham, which was the son of Thara, which was the son of Nachor,

 42:003:035 Which was the son of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which was the son of Phalec, which was the son of Heber, which was the son of Sala,

 42:003:036 Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad, which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was the son of Lamech,

 42:003:037 Which was the son of Mathusala, which was the son of Enoch, which was the son of Jared, which was the son of Maleleel, which was the son of Cainan,

 42:003:038 Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.

 42:004:001 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,

 42:004:002 Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.

 42:004:003 And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.

 42:004:004 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.

 42:004:005 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

 42:004:006 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.

 42:004:007 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.

 42:004:008 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.

 42:004:009 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence:

 42:004:010 For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:

 42:004:011 And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.

 42:004:012 And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.

 42:004:013 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.

 42:004:014 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.

 42:004:015 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.

 42:004:016 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.

 42:004:017 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,

 42:004:018 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,

 42:004:019 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

 42:004:020 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.

 42:004:021 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.

 42:004:022 And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?

 42:004:023 And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.

 42:004:024 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.

 42:004:025 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;

 42:004:026 But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.

 42:004:027 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.

 42:004:028 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,

 42:004:029 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.

 42:004:030 But he passing through the midst of them went his way,

 42:004:031 And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.

 42:004:032 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.

 42:004:033 And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,

 42:004:034 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.

 42:004:035 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.

 42:004:036 And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.

 42:004:037 And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.

 42:004:038 And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her.

 42:004:039 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.

 42:004:040 Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.

 42:004:041 And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.

 42:004:042 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.

 42:004:043 And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.

 42:004:044 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.

 42:005:001 And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,

 42:005:002 And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.

 42:005:003 And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.

 42:005:004 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.

 42:005:005 And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.

 42:005:006 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.

 42:005:007 And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.

 42:005:008 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.

 42:005:009 For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:

 42:005:010 And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.

 42:005:011 And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.

 42:005:012 And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

 42:005:013 And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.

 42:005:014 And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.

 42:005:015 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.

 42:005:016 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.

 42:005:017 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.

 42:005:018 And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.

 42:005:019 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.

 42:005:020 And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.

 42:005:021 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?

 42:005:022 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?

 42:005:023 Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?

 42:005:024 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.

 42:005:025 And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.

 42:005:026 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.

 42:005:027 And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.

 42:005:028 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.

 42:005:029 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.

 42:005:030 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?

 42:005:031 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.

 42:005:032 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

 42:005:033 And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?

 42:005:034 And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

 42:005:035 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.

 42:005:036 And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old.

 42:005:037 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.

 42:005:038 But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.

 42:005:039 No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.

 42:006:001 And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.

 42:006:002 And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?

 42:006:003 And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;

 42:006:004 How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?

 42:006:005 And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

 42:006:006 And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.

 42:006:007 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.

 42:006:008 But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.

 42:006:009 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?

 42:006:010 And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.

 42:006:011 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.

 42:006:012 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.

 42:006:013 And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;

 42:006:014 Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,

 42:006:015 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,

 42:006:016 And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.

 42:006:017 And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;

 42:006:018 And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.

 42:006:019 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.

 42:006:020 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.

 42:006:021 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.

 42:006:022 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.

 42:006:023 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.

 42:006:024 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.

 42:006:025 Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.

 42:006:026 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.

 42:006:027 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,

 42:006:028 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.

 42:006:029 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.

 42:006:030 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.

 42:006:031 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.

 42:006:032 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.

 42:006:033 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.

 42:006:034 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.

 42:006:035 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.

 42:006:036 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.

 42:006:037 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:

 42:006:038 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.

 42:006:039 And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?

 42:006:040 The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.

 42:006:041 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

 42:006:042 Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.

 42:006:043 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

 42:006:044 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.

 42:006:045 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.

 42:006:046 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?

 42:006:047 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:

 42:006:048 He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.

 42:006:049 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.

 42:007:001 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.

 42:007:002 And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.

 42:007:003 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.

 42:007:004 And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:

 42:007:005 For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.

 42:007:006 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:

 42:007:007 Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.

 42:007:008 For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.

 42:007:009 When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.

 42:007:010 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.

 42:007:011 And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.

 42:007:012 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.

 42:007:013 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.

 42:007:014 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.

 42:007:015 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.

 42:007:016 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.

 42:007:017 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.

 42:007:018 And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.

 42:007:019 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?

 42:007:020 When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?

 42:007:021 And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.

 42:007:022 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.

 42:007:023 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

 42:007:024 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?

 42:007:025 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.

 42:007:026 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.

 42:007:027 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

 42:007:028 For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.

 42:007:029 And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.

 42:007:030 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.

 42:007:031 And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?

 42:007:032 They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.

 42:007:033 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.

 42:007:034 The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!

 42:007:035 But wisdom is justified of all her children.

 42:007:036 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.

 42:007:037 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,

 42:007:038 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.

 42:007:039 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.

 42:007:040 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.

 42:007:041 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.

 42:007:042 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?

 42:007:043 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.

 42:007:044 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.

 42:007:045 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.

 42:007:046 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.

 42:007:047 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.

 42:007:048 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.

 42:007:049 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?

 42:007:050 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.

 42:008:001 And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,

 42:008:002 And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,

 42:008:003 And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.

 42:008:004 And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:

 42:008:005 A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.

 42:008:006 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.

 42:008:007 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.

 42:008:008 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

 42:008:009 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?

 42:008:010 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.

 42:008:011 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.

 42:008:012 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.

 42:008:013 They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.

 42:008:014 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.

 42:008:015 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.

 42:008:016 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.

 42:008:017 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.

 42:008:018 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.

 42:008:019 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.

 42:008:020 And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.

 42:008:021 And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.

 42:008:022 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.

 42:008:023 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.

 42:008:024 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.

 42:008:025 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.

 42:008:026 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.

 42:008:027 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.

 42:008:028 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.

 42:008:029 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)

 42:008:030 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.

 42:008:031 And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.

 42:008:032 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.

 42:008:033 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.

 42:008:034 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.

 42:008:035 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.

 42:008:036 They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.

 42:008:037 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.

 42:008:038 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,

 42:008:039 Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.

 42:008:040 And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.

 42:008:041 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:

 42:008:042 For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.

 42:008:043 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,

 42:008:044 Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.

 42:008:045 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

 42:008:046 And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.

 42:008:047 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.

 42:008:048 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.

 42:008:049 While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.

 42:008:050 But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.

 42:008:051 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.

 42:008:052 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.

 42:008:053 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.

 42:008:054 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.

 42:008:055 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.

 42:008:056 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.

 42:009:001 Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.

 42:009:002 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.

 42:009:003 And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.

 42:009:004 And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.

 42:009:005 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.

 42:009:006 And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.

 42:009:007 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;

 42:009:008 And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.

 42:009:009 And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.

 42:009:010 And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.

 42:009:011 And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.

 42:009:012 And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.

 42:009:013 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.

 42:009:014 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.

 42:009:015 And they did so, and made them all sit down.

 42:009:016 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.

 42:009:017 And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.

 42:009:018 And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?

 42:009:019 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.

 42:009:020 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.

 42:009:021 And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;

 42:009:022 Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.

 42:009:023 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.

 42:009:024 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.

 42:009:025 For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?

 42:009:026 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.

 42:009:027 But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.

 42:009:028 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.

 42:009:029 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.

 42:009:030 And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:

 42:009:031 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.

 42:009:032 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.

 42:009:033 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.

 42:009:034 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.

 42:009:035 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.

 42:009:036 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.

 42:009:037 And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.

 42:009:038 And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.

 42:009:039 And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.

 42:009:040 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.

 42:009:041 And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.

 42:009:042 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.

 42:009:043 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,

 42:009:044 Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.

 42:009:045 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.

 42:009:046 Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.

 42:009:047 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,

 42:009:048 And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.

 42:009:049 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.

 42:009:050 And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.

 42:009:051 And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,

 42:009:052 And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.

 42:009:053 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.

 42:009:054 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?

 42:009:055 But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.

 42:009:056 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.

 42:009:057 And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.

 42:009:058 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.

 42:009:059 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.

 42:009:060 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.

 42:009:061 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.

 42:009:062 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

 42:010:001 After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.

 42:010:002 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.

 42:010:003 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.

 42:010:004 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.

 42:010:005 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.

 42:010:006 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.

 42:010:007 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.

 42:010:008 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:

 42:010:009 And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.

 42:010:010 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,

 42:010:011 Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.

 42:010:012 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.

 42:010:013 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

 42:010:014 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.

 42:010:015 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.

 42:010:016 He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.

 42:010:017 And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.

 42:010:018 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.

 42:010:019 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.

 42:010:020 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.

 42:010:021 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.

 42:010:022 All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.

 42:010:023 And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:

 42:010:024 For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.

 42:010:025 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

 42:010:026 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?

 42:010:027 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.

 42:010:028 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.

 42:010:029 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?

 42:010:030 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.

 42:010:031 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.

 42:010:032 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.

 42:010:033 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,

 42:010:034 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

 42:010:035 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.

 42:010:036 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?

 42:010:037 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.

 42:010:038 Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.

 42:010:039 And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.

 42:010:040 But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.

 42:010:041 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:

 42:010:042 But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.

 42:011:001 And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

 42:011:002 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.

 42:011:003 Give us day by day our daily bread.

 42:011:004 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.

 42:011:005 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;

 42:011:006 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?

 42:011:007 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.

 42:011:008 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.

 42:011:009 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

 42:011:010 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

 42:011:011 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?

 42:011:012 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?

 42:011:013 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?

 42:011:014 And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.

 42:011:015 But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.

 42:011:016 And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.

 42:011:017 But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.

 42:011:018 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.

 42:011:019 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.

 42:011:020 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.

 42:011:021 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:

 42:011:022 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.

 42:011:023 He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.

 42:011:024 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.

 42:011:025 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.

 42:011:026 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.

 42:011:027 And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.

 42:011:028 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.

 42:011:029 And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.

 42:011:030 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.

 42:011:031 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

 42:011:032 The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.

 42:011:033 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.

 42:011:034 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.

 42:011:035 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.

 42:011:036 If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.

 42:011:037 And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.

 42:011:038 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.

 42:011:039 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.

 42:011:040 Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?

 42:011:041 But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.

 42:011:042 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.

 42:011:043 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.

 42:011:044 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.

 42:011:045 Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.

 42:011:046 And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.

 42:011:047 Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.

 42:011:048 Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.

 42:011:049 Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:

 42:011:050 That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;

 42:011:051 From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.

 42:011:052 Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.

 42:011:053 And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:

 42:011:054 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.

 42:012:001 In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

 42:012:002 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.

 42:012:003 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.

 42:012:004 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.

 42:012:005 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.

 42:012:006 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?

 42:012:007 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.

 42:012:008 Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:

 42:012:009 But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.

 42:012:010 And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.

 42:012:011 And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:

 42:012:012 For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.

 42:012:013 And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.

 42:012:014 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?

 42:012:015 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.

 42:012:016 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:

 42:012:017 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?

 42:012:018 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.

 42:012:019 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.

 42:012:020 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?

 42:012:021 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.

 42:012:022 And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.

 42:012:023 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.

 42:012:024 Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?

 42:012:025 And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?

 42:012:026 If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?

 42:012:027 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

 42:012:028 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?

 42:012:029 And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.

 42:012:030 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.

 42:012:031 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.

 42:012:032 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

 42:012:033 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.

 42:012:034 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

 42:012:035 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;

 42:012:036 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.

 42:012:037 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.

 42:012:038 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.

 42:012:039 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.

 42:012:040 Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.

 42:012:041 Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?

 42:012:042 And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?

 42:012:043 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.

 42:012:044 Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.

 42:012:045 But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;

 42:012:046 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.

 42:012:047 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.

 42:012:048 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.

 42:012:049 I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?

 42:012:050 But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!

 42:012:051 Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:

 42:012:052 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.

 42:012:053 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.

 42:012:054 And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.

 42:012:055 And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass.

 42:012:056 Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?

 42:012:057 Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?

 42:012:058 When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.

 42:012:059 I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.

 42:013:001 There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

 42:013:002 And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?

 42:013:003 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

 42:013:004 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?

 42:013:005 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

 42:013:006 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.

 42:013:007 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?

 42:013:008 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:

 42:013:009 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.

 42:013:010 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.

 42:013:011 And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself.

 42:013:012 And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.

 42:013:013 And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.

 42:013:014 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.

 42:013:015 The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?

 42:013:016 And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?

 42:013:017 And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.

 42:013:018 Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?

 42:013:019 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.

 42:013:020 And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?

 42:013:021 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

 42:013:022 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.

 42:013:023 Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them,

 42:013:024 Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.

 42:013:025 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:

 42:013:026 Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.

 42:013:027 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.

 42:013:028 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.

 42:013:029 And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.

 42:013:030 And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.

 42:013:031 The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.

 42:013:032 And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.

 42:013:033 Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.

 42:013:034 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!

 42:013:035 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

 42:014:001 And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.

 42:014:002 And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy.

 42:014:003 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?

 42:014:004 And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;

 42:014:005 And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?

 42:014:006 And they could not answer him again to these things.

 42:014:007 And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them.

 42:014:008 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;

 42:014:009 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.

 42:014:010 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.

 42:014:011 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

 42:014:012 Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.

 42:014:013 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:

 42:014:014 And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.

 42:014:015 And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.

 42:014:016 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:

 42:014:017 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.

 42:014:018 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.

 42:014:019 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.

 42:014:020 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.

 42:014:021 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.

 42:014:022 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.

 42:014:023 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.

 42:014:024 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.

 42:014:025 And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,

 42:014:026 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.

 42:014:027 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.

 42:014:028 For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?

 42:014:029 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,

 42:014:030 Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.

 42:014:031 Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?

 42:014:032 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.

 42:014:033 So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.

 42:014:034 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?

 42:014:035 It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

 42:015:001 Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.

 42:015:002 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.

 42:015:003 And he spake this parable unto them, saying,

 42:015:004 What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?

 42:015:005 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.

 42:015:006 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.

 42:015:007 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.

 42:015:008 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?

 42:015:009 And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.

 42:015:010 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.

 42:015:011 And he said, A certain man had two sons:

 42:015:012 And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.

 42:015:013 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.

 42:015:014 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.

 42:015:015 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.

 42:015:016 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.

 42:015:017 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!

 42:015:018 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,

 42:015:019 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.

 42:015:020 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.

 42:015:021 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.

 42:015:022 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:

 42:015:023 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:

 42:015:024 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.

 42:015:025 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.

 42:015:026 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.

 42:015:027 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.

 42:015:028 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.

 42:015:029 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:

 42:015:030 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.

 42:015:031 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.

 42:015:032 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.

 42:016:001 And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.

 42:016:002 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.

 42:016:003 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.

 42:016:004 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.

 42:016:005 So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?

 42:016:006 And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.

 42:016:007 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.

 42:016:008 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.

 42:016:009 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.

 42:016:010 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.

 42:016:011 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?

 42:016:012 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?

 42:016:013 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

 42:016:014 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.

 42:016:015 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.

 42:016:016 The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.

 42:016:017 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.

 42:016:018 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.

 42:016:019 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:

 42:016:020 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,

 42:016:021 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.

 42:016:022 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;

 42:016:023 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

 42:016:024 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

 42:016:025 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

 42:016:026 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.

 42:016:027 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:

 42:016:028 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.

 42:016:029 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.

 42:016:030 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.

 42:016:031 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

 42:017:001 Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!

 42:017:002 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.

 42:017:003 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.

 42:017:004 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.

 42:017:005 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.

 42:017:006 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.

 42:017:007 But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?

 42:017:008 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?

 42:017:009 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.

 42:017:010 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.

 42:017:011 And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

 42:017:012 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:

 42:017:013 And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.

 42:017:014 And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.

 42:017:015 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,

 42:017:016 And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.

 42:017:017 And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?

 42:017:018 There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.

 42:017:019 And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.

 42:017:020 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:

 42:017:021 Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.

 42:017:022 And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.

 42:017:023 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them.

 42:017:024 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.

 42:017:025 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.

 42:017:026 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.

 42:017:027 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.

 42:017:028 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;

 42:017:029 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.

 42:017:030 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.

 42:017:031 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.

 42:017:032 Remember Lot's wife.

 42:017:033 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.

 42:017:034 I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.

 42:017:035 Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.

 42:017:036 Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.

 42:017:037 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.

 42:018:001 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;

 42:018:002 Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:

 42:018:003 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.

 42:018:004 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;

 42:018:005 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.

 42:018:006 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.

 42:018:007 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?

 42:018:008 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?

 42:018:009 And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:

 42:018:010 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.

 42:018:011 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.

 42:018:012 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.

 42:018:013 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.

 42:018:014 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

 42:018:015 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.

 42:018:016 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.

 42:018:017 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.

 42:018:018 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

 42:018:019 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.

 42:018:020 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.

 42:018:021 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.

 42:018:022 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.

 42:018:023 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.

 42:018:024 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!

 42:018:025 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

 42:018:026 And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?

 42:018:027 And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.

 42:018:028 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.

 42:018:029 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,

 42:018:030 Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.

 42:018:031 Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.

 42:018:032 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:

 42:018:033 And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.

 42:018:034 And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.

 42:018:035 And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:

 42:018:036 And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.

 42:018:037 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.

 42:018:038 And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.

 42:018:039 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.

 42:018:040 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,

 42:018:041 Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.

 42:018:042 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.

 42:018:043 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.

 42:019:001 And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.

 42:019:002 And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.

 42:019:003 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.

 42:019:004 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.

 42:019:005 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.

 42:019:006 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.

 42:019:007 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.

 42:019:008 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.

 42:019:009 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.

 42:019:010 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.

 42:019:011 And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.

 42:019:012 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.

 42:019:013 And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.

 42:019:014 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.

 42:019:015 And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.

 42:019:016 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.

 42:019:017 And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.

 42:019:018 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.

 42:019:019 And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.

 42:019:020 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:

 42:019:021 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.

 42:019:022 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:

 42:019:023 Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?

 42:019:024 And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.

 42:019:025 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)

 42:019:026 For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.

 42:019:027 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.

 42:019:028 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.

 42:019:029 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,

 42:019:030 Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.

 42:019:031 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.

 42:019:032 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.

 42:019:033 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?

 42:019:034 And they said, The Lord hath need of him.

 42:019:035 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.

 42:019:036 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.

 42:019:037 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;

 42:019:038 Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.

 42:019:039 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.

 42:019:040 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.

 42:019:041 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,

 42:019:042 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.

 42:019:043 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,

 42:019:044 And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.

 42:019:045 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;

 42:019:046 Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.

 42:019:047 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,

 42:019:048 And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.

 42:020:001 And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,

 42:020:002 And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?

 42:020:003 And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:

 42:020:004 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?

 42:020:005 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?

 42:020:006 But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.

 42:020:007 And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.

 42:020:008 And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.

 42:020:009 Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.

 42:020:010 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.

 42:020:011 And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.

 42:020:012 And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.

 42:020:013 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.

 42:020:014 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.

 42:020:015 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?

 42:020:016 He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.

 42:020:017 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?

 42:020:018 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

 42:020:019 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.

 42:020:020 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.

 42:020:021 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:

 42:020:022 Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?

 42:020:023 But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?

 42:020:024 Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.

 42:020:025 And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.

 42:020:026 And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.

 42:020:027 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,

 42:020:028 Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

 42:020:029 There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.

 42:020:030 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.

 42:020:031 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.

 42:020:032 Last of all the woman died also.

 42:020:033 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.

 42:020:034 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:

 42:020:035 But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:

 42:020:036 Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.

 42:020:037 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

 42:020:038 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.

 42:020:039 Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.

 42:020:040 And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.

 42:020:041 And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?

 42:020:042 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,

 42:020:043 Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.

 42:020:044 David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?

 42:020:045 Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,

 42:020:046 Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;

 42:020:047 Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.

 42:021:001 And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.

 42:021:002 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.

 42:021:003 And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:

 42:021:004 For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.

 42:021:005 And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,

 42:021:006 As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.

 42:021:007 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?

 42:021:008 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.

 42:021:009 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.

 42:021:010 Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:

 42:021:011 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.

 42:021:012 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.

 42:021:013 And it shall turn to you for a testimony.

 42:021:014 Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:

 42:021:015 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.

 42:021:016 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.

 42:021:017 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.

 42:021:018 But there shall not an hair of your head perish.

 42:021:019 In your patience possess ye your souls.

 42:021:020 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.

 42:021:021 Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.

 42:021:022 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.

 42:021:023 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.

 42:021:024 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.

 42:021:025 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;

 42:021:026 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.

 42:021:027 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

 42:021:028 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.

 42:021:029 And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;

 42:021:030 When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.

 42:021:031 So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.

 42:021:032 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.

 42:021:033 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.

 42:021:034 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.

 42:021:035 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.

 42:021:036 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.

 42:021:037 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.

 42:021:038 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.

 42:022:001 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.

 42:022:002 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.

 42:022:003 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.

 42:022:004 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.

 42:022:005 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.

 42:022:006 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.

 42:022:007 Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.

 42:022:008 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.

 42:022:009 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?

 42:022:010 And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.

 42:022:011 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?

 42:022:012 And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.

 42:022:013 And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.

 42:022:014 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.

 42:022:015 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:

 42:022:016 For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

 42:022:017 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:

 42:022:018 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.

 42:022:019 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.

 42:022:020 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.

 42:022:021 But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.

 42:022:022 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!

 42:022:023 And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.

 42:022:024 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.

 42:022:025 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.

 42:022:026 But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.

 42:022:027 For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.

 42:022:028 Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.

 42:022:029 And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;

 42:022:030 That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

 42:022:031 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:

 42:022:032 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

 42:022:033 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.

 42:022:034 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.

 42:022:035 And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.

 42:022:036 Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.

 42:022:037 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.

 42:022:038 And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.

 42:022:039 And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.

 42:022:040 And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.

 42:022:041 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,

 42:022:042 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.

 42:022:043 And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.

 42:022:044 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.

 42:022:045 And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,

 42:022:046 And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.

 42:022:047 And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.

 42:022:048 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?

 42:022:049 When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?

 42:022:050 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.

 42:022:051 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.

 42:022:052 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?

 42:022:053 When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.

 42:022:054 Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.

 42:022:055 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.

 42:022:056 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.

 42:022:057 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.

 42:022:058 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.

 42:022:059 And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.

 42:022:060 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.

 42:022:061 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.

 42:022:062 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.

 42:022:063 And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.

 42:022:064 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?

 42:022:065 And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.

 42:022:066 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,

 42:022:067 Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:

 42:022:068 And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.

 42:022:069 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.

 42:022:070 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.

 42:022:071 And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.

 42:023:001 And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.

 42:023:002 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.

 42:023:003 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.

 42:023:004 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.

 42:023:005 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.

 42:023:006 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.

 42:023:007 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.

 42:023:008 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.

 42:023:009 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.

 42:023:010 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.

 42:023:011 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.

 42:023:012 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.

 42:023:013 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,

 42:023:014 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:

 42:023:015 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.

 42:023:016 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.

 42:023:017 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)

 42:023:018 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:

 42:023:019 (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)

 42:023:020 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.

 42:023:021 But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.

 42:023:022 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.

 42:023:023 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.

 42:023:024 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.

 42:023:025 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.

 42:023:026 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.

 42:023:027 And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.

 42:023:028 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.

 42:023:029 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.

 42:023:030 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.

 42:023:031 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?

 42:023:032 And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.

 42:023:033 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.

 42:023:034 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.

 42:023:035 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.

 42:023:036 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,

 42:023:037 And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.

 42:023:038 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

 42:023:039 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.

 42:023:040 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?

 42:023:041 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.

 42:023:042 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.

 42:023:043 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.

 42:023:044 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.

 42:023:045 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.

 42:023:046 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.

 42:023:047 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.

 42:023:048 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.

 42:023:049 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.

 42:023:050 And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:

 42:023:051 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.

 42:023:052 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.

 42:023:053 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.

 42:023:054 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.

 42:023:055 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.

 42:023:056 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.

 42:024:001 Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.

 42:024:002 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.

 42:024:003 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

 42:024:004 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:

 42:024:005 And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?

 42:024:006 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,

 42:024:007 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.

 42:024:008 And they remembered his words,

 42:024:009 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.

 42:024:010 It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.

 42:024:011 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.

 42:024:012 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.

 42:024:013 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.

 42:024:014 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.

 42:024:015 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.

 42:024:016 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.

 42:024:017 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?

 42:024:018 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?

 42:024:019 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:

 42:024:020 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.

 42:024:021 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.

 42:024:022 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;

 42:024:023 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.

 42:024:024 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.

 42:024:025 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:

 42:024:026 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?

 42:024:027 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.

 42:024:028 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.

 42:024:029 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.

 42:024:030 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.

 42:024:031 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.

 42:024:032 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?

 42:024:033 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,

 42:024:034 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.

 42:024:035 And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.

 42:024:036 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.

 42:024:037 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.

 42:024:038 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?

 42:024:039 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

 42:024:040 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.

 42:024:041 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?

 42:024:042 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.

 42:024:043 And he took it, and did eat before them.

 42:024:044 And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.

 42:024:045 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,

 42:024:046 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:

 42:024:047 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

 42:024:048 And ye are witnesses of these things.

 42:024:049 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.

 42:024:050 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.

 42:024:051 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.

 42:024:052 And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:

 42:024:053 And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.

 Book 43 John

 43:001:001 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

 43:001:002 The same was in the beginning with God.

 43:001:003 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.

 43:001:004 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.

 43:001:005 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

 43:001:006 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.

 43:001:007 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.

 43:001:008 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.

 43:001:009 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.

 43:001:010 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.

 43:001:011 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.

 43:001:012 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:

 43:001:013 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

 43:001:014 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

 43:001:015 John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.

 43:001:016 And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.

 43:001:017 For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.

 43:001:018 No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.

 43:001:019 And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?

 43:001:020 And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.

 43:001:021 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.

 43:001:022 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?

 43:001:023 He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.

 43:001:024 And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.

 43:001:025 And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?

 43:001:026 John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;

 43:001:027 He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.

 43:001:028 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.

 43:001:029 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.

 43:001:030 This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.

 43:001:031 And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.

 43:001:032 And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.

 43:001:033 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.

 43:001:034 And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.

 43:001:035 Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;

 43:001:036 And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!

 43:001:037 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.

 43:001:038 Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?

 43:001:039 He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.

 43:001:040 One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.

 43:001:041 He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.

 43:001:042 And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.

 43:001:043 The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.

 43:001:044 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

 43:001:045 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.

 43:001:046 And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.

 43:001:047 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!

 43:001:048 Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.

 43:001:049 Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.

 43:001:050 Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.

 43:001:051 And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

 43:002:001 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:

 43:002:002 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.

 43:002:003 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.

 43:002:004 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.

 43:002:005 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.

 43:002:006 And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.

 43:002:007 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.

 43:002:008 And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.

 43:002:009 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,

 43:002:010 And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.

 43:002:011 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.

 43:002:012 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.

 43:002:013 And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

 43:002:014 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:

 43:002:015 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;

 43:002:016 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.

 43:002:017 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.

 43:002:018 Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?

 43:002:019 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.

 43:002:020 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?

 43:002:021 But he spake of the temple of his body.

 43:002:022 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.

 43:002:023 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.

 43:002:024 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,

 43:002:025 And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.

 43:003:001 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:

 43:003:002 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.

 43:003:003 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

 43:003:004 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?

 43:003:005 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

 43:003:006 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

 43:003:007 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.

 43:003:008 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.

 43:003:009 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?

 43:003:010 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?

 43:003:011 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.

 43:003:012 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?

 43:003:013 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.

 43:003:014 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:

 43:003:015 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.

 43:003:016 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

 43:003:017 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.

 43:003:018 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

 43:003:019 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.

 43:003:020 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.

 43:003:021 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

 43:003:022 After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.

 43:003:023 And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.

 43:003:024 For John was not yet cast into prison.

 43:003:025 Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.

 43:003:026 And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.

 43:003:027 John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.

 43:003:028 Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.

 43:003:029 He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.

 43:003:030 He must increase, but I must decrease.

 43:003:031 He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.

 43:003:032 And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.

 43:003:033 He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.

 43:003:034 For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.

 43:003:035 The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.

 43:003:036 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

 43:004:001 When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,

 43:004:002 (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)

 43:004:003 He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.

 43:004:004 And he must needs go through Samaria.

 43:004:005 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

 43:004:006 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.

 43:004:007 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.

 43:004:008 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)

 43:004:009 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.

 43:004:010 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.

 43:004:011 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?

 43:004:012 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?

 43:004:013 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:

 43:004:014 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.

 43:004:015 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.

 43:004:016 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.

 43:004:017 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:

 43:004:018 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.

 43:004:019 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.

 43:004:020 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.

 43:004:021 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.

 43:004:022 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.

 43:004:023 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.

 43:004:024 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.

 43:004:025 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.

 43:004:026 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.

 43:004:027 And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?

 43:004:028 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,

 43:004:029 Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?

 43:004:030 Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.

 43:004:031 In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.

 43:004:032 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.

 43:004:033 Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?

 43:004:034 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.

 43:004:035 Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.

 43:004:036 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.

 43:004:037 And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.

 43:004:038 I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.

 43:004:039 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.

 43:004:040 So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.

 43:004:041 And many more believed because of his own word;

 43:004:042 And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.

 43:004:043 Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.

 43:004:044 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.

 43:004:045 Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.

 43:004:046 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.

 43:004:047 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.

 43:004:048 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.

 43:004:049 The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.

 43:004:050 Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.

 43:004:051 And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.

 43:004:052 Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.

 43:004:053 So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.

 43:004:054 This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.

 43:005:001 After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

 43:005:002 Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.

 43:005:003 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.

 43:005:004 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.

 43:005:005 And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.

 43:005:006 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?

 43:005:007 The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.

 43:005:008 Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.

 43:005:009 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.

 43:005:010 The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.

 43:005:011 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.

 43:005:012 Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?

 43:005:013 And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.

 43:005:014 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.

 43:005:015 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.

 43:005:016 And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.

 43:005:017 But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.

 43:005:018 Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.

 43:005:019 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.

 43:005:020 For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.

 43:005:021 For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.

 43:005:022 For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:

 43:005:023 That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.

 43:005:024 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.

 43:005:025 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.

 43:005:026 For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;

 43:005:027 And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.

 43:005:028 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,

 43:005:029 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.

 43:005:030 I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.

 43:005:031 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.

 43:005:032 There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.

 43:005:033 Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.

 43:005:034 But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.

 43:005:035 He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.

 43:005:036 But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.

 43:005:037 And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.

 43:005:038 And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.

 43:005:039 Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.

 43:005:040 And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.

 43:005:041 I receive not honour from men.

 43:005:042 But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.

 43:005:043 I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.

 43:005:044 How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?

 43:005:045 Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.

 43:005:046 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.

 43:005:047 But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?

 43:006:001 After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.

 43:006:002 And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.

 43:006:003 And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.

 43:006:004 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.

 43:006:005 When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?

 43:006:006 And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.

 43:006:007 Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.

 43:006:008 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,

 43:006:009 There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?

 43:006:010 And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.

 43:006:011 And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.

 43:006:012 When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.

 43:006:013 Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.

 43:006:014 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.

 43:006:015 When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.

 43:006:016 And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,

 43:006:017 And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.

 43:006:018 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.

 43:006:019 So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.

 43:006:020 But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.

 43:006:021 Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.

 43:006:022 The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;

 43:006:023 (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)

 43:006:024 When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.

 43:006:025 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?

 43:006:026 Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.

 43:006:027 Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.

 43:006:028 Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?

 43:006:029 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.

 43:006:030 They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?

 43:006:031 Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.

 43:006:032 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.

 43:006:033 For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.

 43:006:034 Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.

 43:006:035 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.

 43:006:036 But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.

 43:006:037 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.

 43:006:038 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.

 43:006:039 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.

 43:006:040 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.

 43:006:041 The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.

 43:006:042 And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?

 43:006:043 Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.

 43:006:044 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.

 43:006:045 It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.

 43:006:046 Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.

 43:006:047 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.

 43:006:048 I am that bread of life.

 43:006:049 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.

 43:006:050 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.

 43:006:051 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.

 43:006:052 The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?

 43:006:053 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.

 43:006:054 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.

 43:006:055 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.

 43:006:056 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.

 43:006:057 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.

 43:006:058 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.

 43:006:059 These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.

 43:006:060 Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?

 43:006:061 When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?

 43:006:062 What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?

 43:006:063 It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.

 43:006:064 But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.

 43:006:065 And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.

 43:006:066 From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.

 43:006:067 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?

 43:006:068 Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.

 43:006:069 And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.

 43:006:070 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?

 43:006:071 He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.

 43:007:001 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.

 43:007:002 Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.

 43:007:003 His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.

 43:007:004 For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.

 43:007:005 For neither did his brethren believe in him.

 43:007:006 Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.

 43:007:007 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.

 43:007:008 Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come.

 43:007:009 When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.

 43:007:010 But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.

 43:007:011 Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?

 43:007:012 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.

 43:007:013 Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.

 43:007:014 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.

 43:007:015 And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?

 43:007:016 Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.

 43:007:017 If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.

 43:007:018 He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.

 43:007:019 Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?

 43:007:020 The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?

 43:007:021 Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.

 43:007:022 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.

 43:007:023 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?

 43:007:024 Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.

 43:007:025 Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?

 43:007:026 But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?

 43:007:027 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.

 43:007:028 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.

 43:007:029 But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.

 43:007:030 Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.

 43:007:031 And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?

 43:007:032 The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.

 43:007:033 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.

 43:007:034 Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.

 43:007:035 Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?

 43:007:036 What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?

 43:007:037 In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.

 43:007:038 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.

 43:007:039 (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)

 43:007:040 Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.

 43:007:041 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?

 43:007:042 Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?

 43:007:043 So there was a division among the people because of him.

 43:007:044 And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.

 43:007:045 Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?

 43:007:046 The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.

 43:007:047 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?

 43:007:048 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?

 43:007:049 But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.

 43:007:050 Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)

 43:007:051 Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?

 43:007:052 They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.

 43:007:053 And every man went unto his own house.

 43:008:001 Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.

 43:008:002 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.

 43:008:003 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,

 43:008:004 They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.

 43:008:005 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?

 43:008:006 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.

 43:008:007 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.

 43:008:008 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.

 43:008:009 And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.

 43:008:010 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?

 43:008:011 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.

 43:008:012 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.

 43:008:013 The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.

 43:008:014 Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.

 43:008:015 Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.

 43:008:016 And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.

 43:008:017 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.

 43:008:018 I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.

 43:008:019 Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.

 43:008:020 These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.

 43:008:021 Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.

 43:008:022 Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.

 43:008:023 And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.

 43:008:024 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.

 43:008:025 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.

 43:008:026 I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.

 43:008:027 They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.

 43:008:028 Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.

 43:008:029 And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.

 43:008:030 As he spake these words, many believed on him.

 43:008:031 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;

 43:008:032 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

 43:008:033 They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?

 43:008:034 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.

 43:008:035 And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.

 43:008:036 If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.

 43:008:037 I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.

 43:008:038 I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.

 43:008:039 They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.

 43:008:040 But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.

 43:008:041 Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.

 43:008:042 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.

 43:008:043 Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.

 43:008:044 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.

 43:008:045 And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.

 43:008:046 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?

 43:008:047 He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.

 43:008:048 Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?

 43:008:049 Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.

 43:008:050 And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.

 43:008:051 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.

 43:008:052 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.

 43:008:053 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?

 43:008:054 Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:

 43:008:055 Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.

 43:008:056 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.

 43:008:057 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?

 43:008:058 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.

 43:008:059 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.

 43:009:001 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.

 43:009:002 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?

 43:009:003 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.

 43:009:004 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.

 43:009:005 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

 43:009:006 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,

 43:009:007 And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.

 43:009:008 The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?

 43:009:009 Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.

 43:009:010 Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?

 43:009:011 He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.

 43:009:012 Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.

 43:009:013 They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.

 43:009:014 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.

 43:009:015 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.

 43:009:016 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.

 43:009:017 They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.

 43:009:018 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.

 43:009:019 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?

 43:009:020 His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:

 43:009:021 But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.

 43:009:022 These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.

 43:009:023 Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.

 43:009:024 Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.

 43:009:025 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.

 43:009:026 Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?

 43:009:027 He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?

 43:009:028 Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.

 43:009:029 We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.

 43:009:030 The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.

 43:009:031 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.

 43:009:032 Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.

 43:009:033 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.

 43:009:034 They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.

 43:009:035 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?

 43:009:036 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?

 43:009:037 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.

 43:009:038 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.

 43:009:039 And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.

 43:009:040 And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?

 43:009:041 Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.

 43:010:001 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.

 43:010:002 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

 43:010:003 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.

 43:010:004 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.

 43:010:005 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.

 43:010:006 This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.

 43:010:007 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.

 43:010:008 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.

 43:010:009 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.

 43:010:010 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.

 43:010:011 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.

 43:010:012 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.

 43:010:013 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.

 43:010:014 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.

 43:010:015 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.

 43:010:016 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.

 43:010:017 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.

 43:010:018 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.

 43:010:019 There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.

 43:010:020 And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?

 43:010:021 Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?

 43:010:022 And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.

 43:010:023 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.

 43:010:024 Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.

 43:010:025 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.

 43:010:026 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.

 43:010:027 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:

 43:010:028 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

 43:010:029 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.

 43:010:030 I and my Father are one.

 43:010:031 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.

 43:010:032 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?

 43:010:033 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.

 43:010:034 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?

 43:010:035 If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;

 43:010:036 Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?

 43:010:037 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.

 43:010:038 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.

 43:010:039 Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,

 43:010:040 And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.

 43:010:041 And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.

 43:010:042 And many believed on him there.

 43:011:001 Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.

 43:011:002 (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)

 43:011:003 Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.

 43:011:004 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.

 43:011:005 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.

 43:011:006 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.

 43:011:007 Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.

 43:011:008 His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?

 43:011:009 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.

 43:011:010 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.

 43:011:011 These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.

 43:011:012 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.

 43:011:013 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.

 43:011:014 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.

 43:011:015 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.

 43:011:016 Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.

 43:011:017 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.

 43:011:018 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:

 43:011:019 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.

 43:011:020 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.

 43:011:021 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.

 43:011:022 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.

 43:011:023 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.

 43:011:024 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.

 43:011:025 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:

 43:011:026 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?

 43:011:027 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.

 43:011:028 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.

 43:011:029 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.

 43:011:030 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.

 43:011:031 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.

 43:011:032 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.

 43:011:033 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.

 43:011:034 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.

 43:011:035 Jesus wept.

 43:011:036 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!

 43:011:037 And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?

 43:011:038 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.

 43:011:039 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.

 43:011:040 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?

 43:011:041 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.

 43:011:042 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.

 43:011:043 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.

 43:011:044 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.

 43:011:045 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.

 43:011:046 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.

 43:011:047 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.

 43:011:048 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.

 43:011:049 And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,

 43:011:050 Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.

 43:011:051 And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;

 43:011:052 And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.

 43:011:053 Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.

 43:011:054 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.

 43:011:055 And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.

 43:011:056 Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?

 43:011:057 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.

 43:012:001 Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.

 43:012:002 There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.

 43:012:003 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.

 43:012:004 Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,

 43:012:005 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?

 43:012:006 This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.

 43:012:007 Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.

 43:012:008 For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.

 43:012:009 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.

 43:012:010 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;

 43:012:011 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.

 43:012:012 On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,

 43:012:013 Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.

 43:012:014 And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,

 43:012:015 Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.

 43:012:016 These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.

 43:012:017 The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.

 43:012:018 For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.

 43:012:019 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.

 43:012:020 And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:

 43:012:021 The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.

 43:012:022 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.

 43:012:023 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.

 43:012:024 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.

 43:012:025 He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.

 43:012:026 If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.

 43:012:027 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.

 43:012:028 Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.

 43:012:029 The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.

 43:012:030 Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.

 43:012:031 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.

 43:012:032 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.

 43:012:033 This he said, signifying what death he should die.

 43:012:034 The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?

 43:012:035 Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.

 43:012:036 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.

 43:012:037 But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:

 43:012:038 That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?

 43:012:039 Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,

 43:012:040 He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.

 43:012:041 These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.

 43:012:042 Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:

 43:012:043 For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.

 43:012:044 Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.

 43:012:045 And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.

 43:012:046 I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.

 43:012:047 And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.

 43:012:048 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.

 43:012:049 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.

 43:012:050 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.

 43:013:001 Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.

 43:013:002 And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;

 43:013:003 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;

 43:013:004 He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.

 43:013:005 After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.

 43:013:006 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?

 43:013:007 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.

 43:013:008 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.

 43:013:009 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.

 43:013:010 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.

 43:013:011 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.

 43:013:012 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?

 43:013:013 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.

 43:013:014 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.

 43:013:015 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.

 43:013:016 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.

 43:013:017 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.

 43:013:018 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.

 43:013:019 Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.

 43:013:020 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.

 43:013:021 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.

 43:013:022 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.

 43:013:023 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.

 43:013:024 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.

 43:013:025 He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?

 43:013:026 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.

 43:013:027 And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.

 43:013:028 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.

 43:013:029 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.

 43:013:030 He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.

 43:013:031 Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.

 43:013:032 If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.

 43:013:033 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.

 43:013:034 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.

 43:013:035 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.

 43:013:036 Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.

 43:013:037 Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.

 43:013:038 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.

 43:014:001 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.

 43:014:002 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

 43:014:003 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.

 43:014:004 And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.

 43:014:005 Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?

 43:014:006 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

 43:014:007 If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.

 43:014:008 Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.

 43:014:009 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?

 43:014:010 Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.

 43:014:011 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.

 43:014:012 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.

 43:014:013 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

 43:014:014 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.

 43:014:015 If ye love me, keep my commandments.

 43:014:016 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;

 43:014:017 Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.

 43:014:018 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.

 43:014:019 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.

 43:014:020 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.

 43:014:021 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.

 43:014:022 Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?

 43:014:023 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.

 43:014:024 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.

 43:014:025 These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.

 43:014:026 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

 43:014:027 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

 43:014:028 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.

 43:014:029 And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.

 43:014:030 Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.

 43:014:031 But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.

 43:015:001 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.

 43:015:002 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.

 43:015:003 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.

 43:015:004 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.

 43:015:005 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.

 43:015:006 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.

 43:015:007 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.

 43:015:008 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.

 43:015:009 As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.

 43:015:010 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.

 43:015:011 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.

 43:015:012 This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.

 43:015:013 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.

 43:015:014 Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.

 43:015:015 Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.

 43:015:016 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.

 43:015:017 These things I command you, that ye love one another.

 43:015:018 If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.

 43:015:019 If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.

 43:015:020 Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.

 43:015:021 But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.

 43:015:022 If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.

 43:015:023 He that hateth me hateth my Father also.

 43:015:024 If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.

 43:015:025 But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.

 43:015:026 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:

 43:015:027 And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.

 43:016:001 These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.

 43:016:002 They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.

 43:016:003 And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.

 43:016:004 But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.

 43:016:005 But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?

 43:016:006 But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.

 43:016:007 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.

 43:016:008 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:

 43:016:009 Of sin, because they believe not on me;

 43:016:010 Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;

 43:016:011 Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.

 43:016:012 I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.

 43:016:013 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.

 43:016:014 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.

 43:016:015 All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.

 43:016:016 A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.

 43:016:017 Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?

 43:016:018 They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.

 43:016:019 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?

 43:016:020 Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.

 43:016:021 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.

 43:016:022 And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.

 43:016:023 And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.

 43:016:024 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.

 43:016:025 These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.

 43:016:026 At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:

 43:016:027 For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.

 43:016:028 I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.

 43:016:029 His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.

 43:016:030 Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.

 43:016:031 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?

 43:016:032 Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.

 43:016:033 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.

 43:017:001 These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:

 43:017:002 As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.

 43:017:003 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.

 43:017:004 I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.

 43:017:005 And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.

 43:017:006 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.

 43:017:007 Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.

 43:017:008 For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.

 43:017:009 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.

 43:017:010 And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.

 43:017:011 And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.

 43:017:012 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.

 43:017:013 And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.

 43:017:014 I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

 43:017:015 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

 43:017:016 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

 43:017:017 Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.

 43:017:018 As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.

 43:017:019 And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.

 43:017:020 Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;

 43:017:021 That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.

 43:017:022 And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:

 43:017:023 I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.

 43:017:024 Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.

 43:017:025 O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.

 43:017:026 And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.

 43:018:001 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.

 43:018:002 And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.

 43:018:003 Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.

 43:018:004 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?

 43:018:005 They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.

 43:018:006 As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.

 43:018:007 Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.

 43:018:008 Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:

 43:018:009 That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.

 43:018:010 Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.

 43:018:011 Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?

 43:018:012 Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,

 43:018:013 And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.

 43:018:014 Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.

 43:018:015 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.

 43:018:016 But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.

 43:018:017 Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.

 43:018:018 And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.

 43:018:019 The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.

 43:018:020 Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.

 43:018:021 Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.

 43:018:022 And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?

 43:018:023 Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?

 43:018:024 Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.

 43:018:025 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.

 43:018:026 One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?

 43:018:027 Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.

 43:018:028 Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.

 43:018:029 Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?

 43:018:030 They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.

 43:018:031 Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:

 43:018:032 That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.

 43:018:033 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?

 43:018:034 Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?

 43:018:035 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?

 43:018:036 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.

 43:018:037 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.

 43:018:038 Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.

 43:018:039 But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?

 43:018:040 Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.

 43:019:001 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.

 43:019:002 And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,

 43:019:003 And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.

 43:019:004 Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.

 43:019:005 Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!

 43:019:006 When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.

 43:019:007 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.

 43:019:008 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;

 43:019:009 And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.

 43:019:010 Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?

 43:019:011 Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.

 43:019:012 And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.

 43:019:013 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.

 43:019:014 And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!

 43:019:015 But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.

 43:019:016 Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.

 43:019:017 And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:

 43:019:018 Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.

 43:019:019 And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.

 43:019:020 This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.

 43:019:021 Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.

 43:019:022 Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.

 43:019:023 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.

 43:019:024 They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.

 43:019:025 Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

 43:019:026 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!

 43:019:027 Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.

 43:019:028 After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.

 43:019:029 Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.

 43:019:030 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.

 43:019:031 The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.

 43:019:032 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.

 43:019:033 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:

 43:019:034 But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.

 43:019:035 And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.

 43:019:036 For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.

 43:019:037 And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.

 43:019:038 And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.

 43:019:039 And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.

 43:019:040 Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.

 43:019:041 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.

 43:019:042 There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.

 43:020:001 The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.

 43:020:002 Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.

 43:020:003 Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.

 43:020:004 So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.

 43:020:005 And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.

 43:020:006 Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,

 43:020:007 And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.

 43:020:008 Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.

 43:020:009 For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.

 43:020:010 Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.

 43:020:011 But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,

 43:020:012 And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.

 43:020:013 And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him.

 43:020:014 And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.

 43:020:015 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.

 43:020:016 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.

 43:020:017 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.

 43:020:018 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her.

 43:020:019 Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.

 43:020:020 And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.

 43:020:021 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.

 43:020:022 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:

 43:020:023 Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.

 43:020:024 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.

 43:020:025 The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the LORD. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.

 43:020:026 And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.

 43:020:027 Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.

 43:020:028 And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.

 43:020:029 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.

 43:020:030 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:

 43:020:031 But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.

 43:021:001 After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.

 43:021:002 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.

 43:021:003 Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.

 43:021:004 But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.

 43:021:005 Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.

 43:021:006 And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.

 43:021:007 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.

 43:021:008 And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.

 43:021:009 As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.

 43:021:010 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.

 43:021:011 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.

 43:021:012 Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.

 43:021:013 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.

 43:021:014 This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.

 43:021:015 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.

 43:021:016 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

 43:021:017 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

 43:021:018 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.

 43:021:019 This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.

 43:021:020 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?

 43:021:021 Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?

 43:021:022 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.

 43:021:023 Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?

 43:021:024 This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.

 43:021:025 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.

 Book 44 Acts

 44:001:001 The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,

 44:001:002 Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:

 44:001:003 To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:

 44:001:004 And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.

 44:001:005 For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.

 44:001:006 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?

 44:001:007 And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.

 44:001:008 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

 44:001:009 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.

 44:001:010 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;

 44:001:011 Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.

 44:001:012 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.

 44:001:013 And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.

 44:001:014 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.

 44:001:015 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)

 44:001:016 Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.

 44:001:017 For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.

 44:001:018 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.

 44:001:019 And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.

 44:001:020 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.

 44:001:021 Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,

 44:001:022 Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.

 44:001:023 And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.

 44:001:024 And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,

 44:001:025 That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.

 44:001:026 And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

 44:002:001 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.

 44:002:002 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.

 44:002:003 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.

 44:002:004 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

 44:002:005 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.

 44:002:006 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.

 44:002:007 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?

 44:002:008 And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?

 44:002:009 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,

 44:002:010 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,

 44:002:011 Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.

 44:002:012 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?

 44:002:013 Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.

 44:002:014 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:

 44:002:015 For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.

 44:002:016 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;

 44:002:017 And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:

 44:002:018 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:

 44:002:019 And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:

 44:002:020 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come:

 44:002:021 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.

 44:002:022 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:

 44:002:023 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:

 44:002:024 Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.

 44:002:025 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:

 44:002:026 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:

 44:002:027 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

 44:002:028 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.

 44:002:029 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.

 44:002:030 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;

 44:002:031 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.

 44:002:032 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.

 44:002:033 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.

 44:002:034 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,

 44:002:035 Until I make thy foes thy footstool.

 44:002:036 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.

 44:002:037 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?

 44:002:038 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

 44:002:039 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.

 44:002:040 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.

 44:002:041 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.

 44:002:042 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.

 44:002:043 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.

 44:002:044 And all that believed were together, and had all things common;

 44:002:045 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.

 44:002:046 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,

 44:002:047 Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.

 44:003:001 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.

 44:003:002 And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;

 44:003:003 Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.

 44:003:004 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.

 44:003:005 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.

 44:003:006 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.

 44:003:007 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.

 44:003:008 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.

 44:003:009 And all the people saw him walking and praising God:

 44:003:010 And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.

 44:003:011 And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.

 44:003:012 And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?

 44:003:013 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.

 44:003:014 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;

 44:003:015 And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.

 44:003:016 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.

 44:003:017 And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.

 44:003:018 But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.

 44:003:019 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.

 44:003:020 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:

 44:003:021 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.

 44:003:022 For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.

 44:003:023 And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.

 44:003:024 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.

 44:003:025 Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.

 44:003:026 Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.

 44:004:001 And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,

 44:004:002 Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.

 44:004:003 And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.

 44:004:004 Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.

 44:004:005 And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,

 44:004:006 And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.

 44:004:007 And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?

 44:004:008 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,

 44:004:009 If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;

 44:004:010 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.

 44:004:011 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.

 44:004:012 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

 44:004:013 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.

 44:004:014 And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.

 44:004:015 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,

 44:004:016 Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.

 44:004:017 But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.

 44:004:018 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.

 44:004:019 But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.

 44:004:020 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.

 44:004:021 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.

 44:004:022 For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.

 44:004:023 And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.

 44:004:024 And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:

 44:004:025 Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?

 44:004:026 The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.

 44:004:027 For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,

 44:004:028 For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.

 44:004:029 And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,

 44:004:030 By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.

 44:004:031 And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.

 44:004:032 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.

 44:004:033 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.

 44:004:034 Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,

 44:004:035 And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.

 44:004:036 And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,

 44:004:037 Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.

 44:005:001 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,

 44:005:002 And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.

 44:005:003 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?

 44:005:004 Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.

 44:005:005 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.

 44:005:006 And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.

 44:005:007 And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.

 44:005:008 And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.

 44:005:009 Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.

 44:005:010 Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.

 44:005:011 And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.

 44:005:012 And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.

 44:005:013 And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.

 44:005:014 And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)

 44:005:015 Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.

 44:005:016 There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.

 44:005:017 Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,

 44:005:018 And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.

 44:005:019 But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,

 44:005:020 Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.

 44:005:021 And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.

 44:005:022 But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and told,

 44:005:023 Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.

 44:005:024 Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.

 44:005:025 Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.

 44:005:026 Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.

 44:005:027 And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,

 44:005:028 Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.

 44:005:029 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.

 44:005:030 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.

 44:005:031 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.

 44:005:032 And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.

 44:005:033 When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.

 44:005:034 Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;

 44:005:035 And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.

 44:005:036 For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.

 44:005:037 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.

 44:005:038 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:

 44:005:039 But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.

 44:005:040 And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.

 44:005:041 And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.

 44:005:042 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.

 44:006:001 And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.

 44:006:002 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.

 44:006:003 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.

 44:006:004 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.

 44:006:005 And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:

 44:006:006 Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.

 44:006:007 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.

 44:006:008 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.

 44:006:009 Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.

 44:006:010 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.

 44:006:011 Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.

 44:006:012 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,

 44:006:013 And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:

 44:006:014 For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.

 44:006:015 And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.

 44:007:001 Then said the high priest, Are these things so?

 44:007:002 And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,

 44:007:003 And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.

 44:007:004 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.

 44:007:005 And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.

 44:007:006 And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.

 44:007:007 And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.

 44:007:008 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.

 44:007:009 And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,

 44:007:010 And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.

 44:007:011 Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.

 44:007:012 But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.

 44:007:013 And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.

 44:007:014 Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.

 44:007:015 So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,

 44:007:016 And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.

 44:007:017 But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,

 44:007:018 Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.

 44:007:019 The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.

 44:007:020 In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:

 44:007:021 And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.

 44:007:022 And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.

 44:007:023 And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.

 44:007:024 And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:

 44:007:025 For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.

 44:007:026 And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?

 44:007:027 But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?

 44:007:028 Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?

 44:007:029 Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.

 44:007:030 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.

 44:007:031 When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him,

 44:007:032 Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.

 44:007:033 Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.

 44:007:034 I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.

 44:007:035 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.

 44:007:036 He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.

 44:007:037 This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.

 44:007:038 This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:

 44:007:039 To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,

 44:007:040 Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

 44:007:041 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.

 44:007:042 Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?

 44:007:043 Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.

 44:007:044 Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.

 44:007:045 Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;

 44:007:046 Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.

 44:007:047 But Solomon built him an house.

 44:007:048 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,

 44:007:049 Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?

 44:007:050 Hath not my hand made all these things?

 44:007:051 Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.

 44:007:052 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:

 44:007:053 Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.

 44:007:054 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.

 44:007:055 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,

 44:007:056 And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.

 44:007:057 Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,

 44:007:058 And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.

 44:007:059 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.

 44:007:060 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

 44:008:001 And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.

 44:008:002 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.

 44:008:003 As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.

 44:008:004 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.

 44:008:005 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.

 44:008:006 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.

 44:008:007 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.

 44:008:008 And there was great joy in that city.

 44:008:009 But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:

 44:008:010 To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.

 44:008:011 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.

 44:008:012 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.

 44:008:013 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.

 44:008:014 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:

 44:008:015 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:

 44:008:016 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)

 44:008:017 Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.

 44:008:018 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,

 44:008:019 Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.

 44:008:020 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.

 44:008:021 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.

 44:008:022 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.

 44:008:023 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.

 44:008:024 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.

 44:008:025 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.

 44:008:026 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.

 44:008:027 And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,

 44:008:028 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.

 44:008:029 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.

 44:008:030 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?

 44:008:031 And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.

 44:008:032 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:

 44:008:033 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.

 44:008:034 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?

 44:008:035 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.

 44:008:036 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?

 44:008:037 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

 44:008:038 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.

 44:008:039 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.

 44:008:040 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.

 44:009:001 And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,

 44:009:002 And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.

 44:009:003 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:

 44:009:004 And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

 44:009:005 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

 44:009:006 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.

 44:009:007 And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.

 44:009:008 And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.

 44:009:009 And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.

 44:009:010 And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.

 44:009:011 And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,

 44:009:012 And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.

 44:009:013 Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:

 44:009:014 And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.

 44:009:015 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:

 44:009:016 For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.

 44:009:017 And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.

 44:009:018 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.

 44:009:019 And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.

 44:009:020 And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.

 44:009:021 But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?

 44:009:022 But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.

 44:009:023 And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:

 44:009:024 But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.

 44:009:025 Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.

 44:009:026 And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.

 44:009:027 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.

 44:009:028 And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.

 44:009:029 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.

 44:009:030 Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.

 44:009:031 Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.

 44:009:032 And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.

 44:009:033 And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.

 44:009:034 And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.

 44:009:035 And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.

 44:009:036 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.

 44:009:037 And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.

 44:009:038 And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.

 44:009:039 Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.

 44:009:040 But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.

 44:009:041 And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.

 44:009:042 And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.

 44:009:043 And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.

 44:010:001 There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,

 44:010:002 A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.

 44:010:003 He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.

 44:010:004 And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.

 44:010:005 And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:

 44:010:006 He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.

 44:010:007 And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;

 44:010:008 And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.

 44:010:009 On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:

 44:010:010 And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,

 44:010:011 And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:

 44:010:012 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.

 44:010:013 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.

 44:010:014 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.

 44:010:015 And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.

 44:010:016 This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.

 44:010:017 Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,

 44:010:018 And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.

 44:010:019 While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.

 44:010:020 Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.

 44:010:021 Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?

 44:010:022 And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.

 44:010:023 Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.

 44:010:024 And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends.

 44:010:025 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.

 44:010:026 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.

 44:010:027 And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.

 44:010:028 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.

 44:010:029 Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?

 44:010:030 And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,

 44:010:031 And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.

 44:010:032 Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.

 44:010:033 Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.

 44:010:034 Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:

 44:010:035 But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.

 44:010:036 The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)

 44:010:037 That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;

 44:010:038 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.

 44:010:039 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:

 44:010:040 Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;

 44:010:041 Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.

 44:010:042 And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.

 44:010:043 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.

 44:010:044 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.

 44:010:045 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.

 44:010:046 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,

 44:010:047 Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?

 44:010:048 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.

 44:011:001 And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.

 44:011:002 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,

 44:011:003 Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.

 44:011:004 But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,

 44:011:005 I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:

 44:011:006 Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.

 44:011:007 And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.

 44:011:008 But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.

 44:011:009 But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.

 44:011:010 And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.

 44:011:011 And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.

 44:011:012 And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:

 44:011:013 And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;

 44:011:014 Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.

 44:011:015 And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.

 44:011:016 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.

 44:011:017 Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?

 44:011:018 When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.

 44:011:019 Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.

 44:011:020 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.

 44:011:021 And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.

 44:011:022 Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.

 44:011:023 Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.

 44:011:024 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.

 44:011:025 Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:

 44:011:026 And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.

 44:011:027 And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.

 44:011:028 And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.

 44:011:029 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:

 44:011:030 Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.

 44:012:001 Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.

 44:012:002 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.

 44:012:003 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)

 44:012:004 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.

 44:012:005 Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.

 44:012:006 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.

 44:012:007 And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.

 44:012:008 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.

 44:012:009 And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.

 44:012:010 When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.

 44:012:011 And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.

 44:012:012 And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.

 44:012:013 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.

 44:012:014 And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.

 44:012:015 And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.

 44:012:016 But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.

 44:012:017 But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.

 44:012:018 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.

 44:012:019 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.

 44:012:020 And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.

 44:012:021 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.

 44:012:022 And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.

 44:012:023 And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.

 44:012:024 But the word of God grew and multiplied.

 44:012:025 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.

 44:013:001 Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.

 44:013:002 As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.

 44:013:003 And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.

 44:013:004 So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.

 44:013:005 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.

 44:013:006 And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:

 44:013:007 Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.

 44:013:008 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.

 44:013:009 Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him.

 44:013:010 And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?

 44:013:011 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.

 44:013:012 Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.

 44:013:013 Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.

 44:013:014 But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.

 44:013:015 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.

 44:013:016 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.

 44:013:017 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.

 44:013:018 And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.

 44:013:019 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.

 44:013:020 And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.

 44:013:021 And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.

 44:013:022 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave their testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.

 44:013:023 Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:

 44:013:024 When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.

 44:013:025 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.

 44:013:026 Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.

 44:013:027 For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.

 44:013:028 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.

 44:013:029 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.

 44:013:030 But God raised him from the dead:

 44:013:031 And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.

 44:013:032 And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,

 44:013:033 God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.

 44:013:034 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.

 44:013:035 Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

 44:013:036 For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:

 44:013:037 But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.

 44:013:038 Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:

 44:013:039 And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.

 44:013:040 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;

 44:013:041 Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.

 44:013:042 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.

 44:013:043 Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.

 44:013:044 And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.

 44:013:045 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.

 44:013:046 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.

 44:013:047 For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.

 44:013:048 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.

 44:013:049 And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.

 44:013:050 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.

 44:013:051 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.

 44:013:052 And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.

 44:014:001 And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.

 44:014:002 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.

 44:014:003 Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.

 44:014:004 But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.

 44:014:005 And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,

 44:014:006 They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:

 44:014:007 And there they preached the gospel.

 44:014:008 And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:

 44:014:009 The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,

 44:014:010 Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.

 44:014:011 And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.

 44:014:012 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.

 44:014:013 Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.

 44:014:014 Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,

 44:014:015 And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:

 44:014:016 Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.

 44:014:017 Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.

 44:014:018 And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.

 44:014:019 And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.

 44:014:020 Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.

 44:014:021 And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,

 44:014:022 Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.

 44:014:023 And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.

 44:014:024 And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.

 44:014:025 And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:

 44:014:026 And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.

 44:014:027 And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.

 44:014:028 And there they abode long time with the disciples.

 44:015:001 And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.

 44:015:002 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.

 44:015:003 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.

 44:015:004 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.

 44:015:005 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.

 44:015:006 And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.

 44:015:007 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.

 44:015:008 And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;

 44:015:009 And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.

 44:015:010 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?

 44:015:011 But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.

 44:015:012 Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.

 44:015:013 And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:

 44:015:014 Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.

 44:015:015 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,

 44:015:016 After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:

 44:015:017 That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.

 44:015:018 Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.

 44:015:019 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:

 44:015:020 But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.

 44:015:021 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.

 44:015:022 Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brethren:

 44:015:023 And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.

 44:015:024 Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:

 44:015:025 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

 44:015:026 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

 44:015:027 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.

 44:015:028 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;

 44:015:029 That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.

 44:015:030 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:

 44:015:031 Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.

 44:015:032 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.

 44:015:033 And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.

 44:015:034 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.

 44:015:035 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.

 44:015:036 And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do.

 44:015:037 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.

 44:015:038 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.

 44:015:039 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;

 44:015:040 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.

 44:015:041 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.

 44:016:001 Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:

 44:016:002 Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.

 44:016:003 Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.

 44:016:004 And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.

 44:016:005 And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.

 44:016:006 Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,

 44:016:007 After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.

 44:016:008 And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.

 44:016:009 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.

 44:016:010 And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.

 44:016:011 Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;

 44:016:012 And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.

 44:016:013 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.

 44:016:014 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.

 44:016:015 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.

 44:016:016 And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:

 44:016:017 The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.

 44:016:018 And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.

 44:016:019 And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,

 44:016:020 And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,

 44:016:021 And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.

 44:016:022 And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.

 44:016:023 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:

 44:016:024 Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.

 44:016:025 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.

 44:016:026 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.

 44:016:027 And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.

 44:016:028 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.

 44:016:029 Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,

 44:016:030 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?

 44:016:031 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.

 44:016:032 And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.

 44:016:033 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.

 44:016:034 And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.

 44:016:035 And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.

 44:016:036 And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.

 44:016:037 But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.

 44:016:038 And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.

 44:016:039 And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.

 44:016:040 And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.

 44:017:001 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:

 44:017:002 And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,

 44:017:003 Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.

 44:017:004 And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.

 44:017:005 But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.

 44:017:006 And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;

 44:017:007 Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.

 44:017:008 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.

 44:017:009 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.

 44:017:010 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.

 44:017:011 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.

 44:017:012 Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.

 44:017:013 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.

 44:017:014 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.

 44:017:015 And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.

 44:017:016 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.

 44:017:017 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.

 44:017:018 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.

 44:017:019 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?

 44:017:020 For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.

 44:017:021 (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)

 44:017:022 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.

 44:017:023 For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.

 44:017:024 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;

 44:017:025 Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;

 44:017:026 And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;

 44:017:027 That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:

 44:017:028 For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.

 44:017:029 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.

 44:017:030 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:

 44:017:031 Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.

 44:017:032 And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.

 44:017:033 So Paul departed from among them.

 44:017:034 Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.

 44:018:001 After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;

 44:018:002 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.

 44:018:003 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.

 44:018:004 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.

 44:018:005 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.

 44:018:006 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean; from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.

 44:018:007 And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.

 44:018:008 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.

 44:018:009 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:

 44:018:010 For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.

 44:018:011 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.

 44:018:012 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,

 44:018:013 Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.

 44:018:014 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:

 44:018:015 But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.

 44:018:016 And he drave them from the judgment seat.

 44:018:017 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.

 44:018:018 And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.

 44:018:019 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.

 44:018:020 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;

 44:018:021 But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.

 44:018:022 And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.

 44:018:023 And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.

 44:018:024 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.

 44:018:025 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.

 44:018:026 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.

 44:018:027 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:

 44:018:028 For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.

 44:019:001 And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,

 44:019:002 He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.

 44:019:003 And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.

 44:019:004 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.

 44:019:005 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.

 44:019:006 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.

 44:019:007 And all the men were about twelve.

 44:019:008 And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.

 44:019:009 But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.

 44:019:010 And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.

 44:019:011 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:

 44:019:012 So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.

 44:019:013 Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.

 44:019:014 And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.

 44:019:015 And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?

 44:019:016 And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.

 44:019:017 And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.

 44:019:018 And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.

 44:019:019 Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.

 44:019:020 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.

 44:019:021 After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.

 44:019:022 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.

 44:019:023 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.

 44:019:024 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;

 44:019:025 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.

 44:019:026 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:

 44:019:027 So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.

 44:019:028 And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

 44:019:029 And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.

 44:019:030 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.

 44:019:031 And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.

 44:019:032 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.

 44:019:033 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.

 44:019:034 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

 44:019:035 And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?

 44:019:036 Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.

 44:019:037 For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.

 44:019:038 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.

 44:019:039 But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.

 44:019:040 For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.

 44:019:041 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.

 44:020:001 And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.

 44:020:002 And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,

 44:020:003 And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.

 44:020:004 And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.

 44:020:005 These going before tarried for us at Troas.

 44:020:006 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.

 44:020:007 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.

 44:020:008 And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.

 44:020:009 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.

 44:020:010 And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.

 44:020:011 When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.

 44:020:012 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.

 44:020:013 And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.

 44:020:014 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.

 44:020:015 And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.

 44:020:016 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.

 44:020:017 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.

 44:020:018 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,

 44:020:019 Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:

 44:020:020 And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,

 44:020:021 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

 44:020:022 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:

 44:020:023 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.

 44:020:024 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

 44:020:025 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.

 44:020:026 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.

 44:020:027 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.

 44:020:028 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.

 44:020:029 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.

 44:020:030 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.

 44:020:031 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.

 44:020:032 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.

 44:020:033 I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.

 44:020:034 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.

 44:020:035 I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.

 44:020:036 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.

 44:020:037 And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,

 44:020:038 Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.

 44:021:001 And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:

 44:021:002 And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.

 44:021:003 Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.

 44:021:004 And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.

 44:021:005 And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.

 44:021:006 And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.

 44:021:007 And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.

 44:021:008 And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.

 44:021:009 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.

 44:021:010 And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.

 44:021:011 And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.

 44:021:012 And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.

 44:021:013 Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.

 44:021:014 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.

 44:021:015 And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.

 44:021:016 There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.

 44:021:017 And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.

 44:021:018 And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.

 44:021:019 And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.

 44:021:020 And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:

 44:021:021 And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.

 44:021:022 What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.

 44:021:023 Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;

 44:021:024 Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.

 44:021:025 As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.

 44:021:026 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.

 44:021:027 And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,

 44:021:028 Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.

 44:021:029 (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)

 44:021:030 And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.

 44:021:031 And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.

 44:021:032 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.

 44:021:033 Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.

 44:021:034 And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.

 44:021:035 And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.

 44:021:036 For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.

 44:021:037 And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?

 44:021:038 Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?

 44:021:039 But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.

 44:021:040 And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,

 44:022:001 Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you.

 44:022:002 (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)

 44:022:003 I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.

 44:022:004 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.

 44:022:005 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.

 44:022:006 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.

 44:022:007 And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

 44:022:008 And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.

 44:022:009 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.

 44:022:010 And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.

 44:022:011 And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.

 44:022:012 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,

 44:022:013 Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.

 44:022:014 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.

 44:022:015 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.

 44:022:016 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.

 44:022:017 And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;

 44:022:018 And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.

 44:022:019 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:

 44:022:020 And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.

 44:022:021 And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.

 44:022:022 And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.

 44:022:023 And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,

 44:022:024 The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.

 44:022:025 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?

 44:022:026 When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.

 44:022:027 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.

 44:022:028 And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.

 44:022:029 Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.

 44:022:030 On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.

 44:023:001 And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.

 44:023:002 And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.

 44:023:003 Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?

 44:023:004 And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?

 44:023:005 Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.

 44:023:006 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.

 44:023:007 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.

 44:023:008 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.

 44:023:009 And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.

 44:023:010 And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.

 44:023:011 And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.

 44:023:012 And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.

 44:023:013 And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.

 44:023:014 And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.

 44:023:015 Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.

 44:023:016 And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.

 44:023:017 Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.

 44:023:018 So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.

 44:023:019 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?

 44:023:020 And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.

 44:023:021 But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.

 44:023:022 So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.

 44:023:023 And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;

 44:023:024 And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.

 44:023:025 And he wrote a letter after this manner:

 44:023:026 Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.

 44:023:027 This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.

 44:023:028 And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:

 44:023:029 Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.

 44:023:030 And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.

 44:023:031 Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.

 44:023:032 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:

 44:023:033 Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.

 44:023:034 And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;

 44:023:035 I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.

 44:024:001 And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.

 44:024:002 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,

 44:024:003 We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.

 44:024:004 Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.

 44:024:005 For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:

 44:024:006 Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.

 44:024:007 But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,

 44:024:008 Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.

 44:024:009 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.

 44:024:010 Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:

 44:024:011 Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.

 44:024:012 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:

 44:024:013 Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.

 44:024:014 But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:

 44:024:015 And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.

 44:024:016 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offence toward God, and toward men.

 44:024:017 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.

 44:024:018 Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.

 44:024:019 Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.

 44:024:020 Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,

 44:024:021 Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.

 44:024:022 And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.

 44:024:023 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.

 44:024:024 And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.

 44:024:025 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.

 44:024:026 He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.

 44:024:027 But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.

 44:025:001 Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.

 44:025:002 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,

 44:025:003 And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.

 44:025:004 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.

 44:025:005 Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.

 44:025:006 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.

 44:025:007 And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.

 44:025:008 While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.

 44:025:009 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?

 44:025:010 Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.

 44:025:011 For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.

 44:025:012 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.

 44:025:013 And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.

 44:025:014 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:

 44:025:015 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.

 44:025:016 To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.

 44:025:017 Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.

 44:025:018 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:

 44:025:019 But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.

 44:025:020 And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.

 44:025:021 But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.

 44:025:022 Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.

 44:025:023 And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.

 44:025:024 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.

 44:025:025 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.

 44:025:026 Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.

 44:025:027 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.

 44:026:001 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:

 44:026:002 I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:

 44:026:003 Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.

 44:026:004 My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;

 44:026:005 Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.

 44:026:006 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, unto our fathers:

 44:026:007 Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.

 44:026:008 Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?

 44:026:009 I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

 44:026:010 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.

 44:026:011 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.

 44:026:012 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,

 44:026:013 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.

 44:026:014 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

 44:026:015 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.

 44:026:016 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;

 44:026:017 Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,

 44:026:018 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.

 44:026:019 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:

 44:026:020 But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.

 44:026:021 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.

 44:026:022 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:

 44:026:023 That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.

 44:026:024 And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.

 44:026:025 But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.

 44:026:026 For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.

 44:026:027 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.

 44:026:028 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.

 44:026:029 And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.

 44:026:030 And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:

 44:026:031 And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.

 44:026:032 Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.

 44:027:001 And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.

 44:027:002 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.

 44:027:003 And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.

 44:027:004 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.

 44:027:005 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.

 44:027:006 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.

 44:027:007 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;

 44:027:008 And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.

 44:027:009 Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,

 44:027:010 And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.

 44:027:011 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.

 44:027:012 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.

 44:027:013 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.

 44:027:014 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.

 44:027:015 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.

 44:027:016 And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:

 44:027:017 Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.

 44:027:018 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;

 44:027:019 And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.

 44:027:020 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.

 44:027:021 But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.

 44:027:022 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.

 44:027:023 For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,

 44:027:024 Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.

 44:027:025 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.

 44:027:026 Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.

 44:027:027 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;

 44:027:028 And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.

 44:027:029 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.

 44:027:030 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,

 44:027:031 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.

 44:027:032 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.

 44:027:033 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.

 44:027:034 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.

 44:027:035 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.

 44:027:036 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.

 44:027:037 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.

 44:027:038 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.

 44:027:039 And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.

 44:027:040 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.

 44:027:041 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.

 44:027:042 And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.

 44:027:043 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:

 44:027:044 And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.

 44:028:001 And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.

 44:028:002 And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.

 44:028:003 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.

 44:028:004 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.

 44:028:005 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.

 44:028:006 Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.

 44:028:007 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.

 44:028:008 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.

 44:028:009 So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:

 44:028:010 Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.

 44:028:011 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.

 44:028:012 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.

 44:028:013 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:

 44:028:014 Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.

 44:028:015 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.

 44:028:016 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.

 44:028:017 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.

 44:028:018 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.

 44:028:019 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.

 44:028:020 For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.

 44:028:021 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.

 44:028:022 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.

 44:028:023 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.

 44:028:024 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.

 44:028:025 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,

 44:028:026 Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:

 44:028:027 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.

 44:028:028 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.

 44:028:029 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.

 44:028:030 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,

 44:028:031 Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.

 Book 45 Romans

 45:001:001 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,

 45:001:002 (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)

 45:001:003 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;

 45:001:004 And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:

 45:001:005 By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:

 45:001:006 Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:

 45:001:007 To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

 45:001:008 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.

 45:001:009 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;

 45:001:010 Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.

 45:001:011 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;

 45:001:012 That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.

 45:001:013 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.

 45:001:014 I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.

 45:001:015 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.

 45:001:016 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

 45:001:017 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

 45:001:018 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;

 45:001:019 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.

 45:001:020 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:

 45:001:021 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.

 45:001:022 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

 45:001:023 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.

 45:001:024 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:

 45:001:025 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.

 45:001:026 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:

 45:001:027 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.

 45:001:028 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;

 45:001:029 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,

 45:001:030 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

 45:001:031 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:

 45:001:032 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.

 45:002:001 Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.

 45:002:002 But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.

 45:002:003 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?

 45:002:004 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?

 45:002:005 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;

 45:002:006 Who will render to every man according to his deeds:

 45:002:007 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:

 45:002:008 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,

 45:002:009 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;

 45:002:010 But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:

 45:002:011 For there is no respect of persons with God.

 45:002:012 For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;

 45:002:013 (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.

 45:002:014 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:

 45:002:015 Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)

 45:002:016 In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.

 45:002:017 Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,

 45:002:018 And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;

 45:002:019 And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,

 45:002:020 An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.

 45:002:021 Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?

 45:002:022 Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?

 45:002:023 Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?

 45:002:024 For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.

 45:002:025 For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.

 45:002:026 Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?

 45:002:027 And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?

 45:002:028 For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:

 45:002:029 But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.

 45:003:001 What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?

 45:003:002 Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.

 45:003:003 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?

 45:003:004 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.

 45:003:005 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)

 45:003:006 God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?

 45:003:007 For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?

 45:003:008 And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.

 45:003:009 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;

 45:003:010 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:

 45:003:011 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.

 45:003:012 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

 45:003:013 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:

 45:003:014 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:

 45:003:015 Their feet are swift to shed blood:

 45:003:016 Destruction and misery are in their ways:

 45:003:017 And the way of peace have they not known:

 45:003:018 There is no fear of God before their eyes.

 45:003:019 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.

 45:003:020 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.

 45:003:021 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;

 45:003:022 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:

 45:003:023 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

 45:003:024 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:

 45:003:025 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

 45:003:026 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.

 45:003:027 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.

 45:003:028 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.

 45:003:029 Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:

 45:003:030 Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.

 45:003:031 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.

 45:004:001 What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?

 45:004:002 For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.

 45:004:003 For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.

 45:004:004 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.

 45:004:005 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.

 45:004:006 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,

 45:004:007 Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.

 45:004:008 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.

 45:004:009 Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.

 45:004:010 How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

 45:004:011 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:

 45:004:012 And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.

 45:004:013 For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.

 45:004:014 For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:

 45:004:015 Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.

 45:004:016 Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,

 45:004:017 (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.

 45:004:018 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.

 45:004:019 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:

 45:004:020 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;

 45:004:021 And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.

 45:004:022 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.

 45:004:023 Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;

 45:004:024 But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;

 45:004:025 Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.

 45:005:001 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:

 45:005:002 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

 45:005:003 And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;

 45:005:004 And patience, experience; and experience, hope:

 45:005:005 And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.

 45:005:006 For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.

 45:005:007 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.

 45:005:008 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

 45:005:009 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.

 45:005:010 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.

 45:005:011 And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.

 45:005:012 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:

 45:005:013 (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.

 45:005:014 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.

 45:005:015 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.

 45:005:016 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.

 45:005:017 For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)

 45:005:018 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.

 45:005:019 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.

 45:005:020 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:

 45:005:021 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.

 45:006:001 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?

 45:006:002 God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?

 45:006:003 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?

 45:006:004 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

 45:006:005 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:

 45:006:006 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.

 45:006:007 For he that is dead is freed from sin.

 45:006:008 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:

 45:006:009 Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.

 45:006:010 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.

 45:006:011 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

 45:006:012 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.

 45:006:013 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.

 45:006:014 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.

 45:006:015 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.

 45:006:016 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?

 45:006:017 But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.

 45:006:018 Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.

 45:006:019 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.

 45:006:020 For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.

 45:006:021 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.

 45:006:022 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.

 45:006:023 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

 45:007:001 Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?

 45:007:002 For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.

 45:007:003 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.

 45:007:004 Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.

 45:007:005 For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.

 45:007:006 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.

 45:007:007 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.

 45:007:008 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.

 45:007:009 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.

 45:007:010 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.

 45:007:011 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.

 45:007:012 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.

 45:007:013 Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.

 45:007:014 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.

 45:007:015 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.

 45:007:016 If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.

 45:007:017 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.

 45:007:018 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.

 45:007:019 For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.

 45:007:020 Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.

 45:007:021 I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.

 45:007:022 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:

 45:007:023 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.

 45:007:024 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

 45:007:025 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.

 45:008:001 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

 45:008:002 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.

 45:008:003 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:

 45:008:004 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

 45:008:005 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.

 45:008:006 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.

 45:008:007 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.

 45:008:008 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.

 45:008:009 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.

 45:008:010 And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.

 45:008:011 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.

 45:008:012 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.

 45:008:013 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.

 45:008:014 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

 45:008:015 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

 45:008:016 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:

 45:008:017 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.

 45:008:018 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.

 45:008:019 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.

 45:008:020 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,

 45:008:021 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.

 45:008:022 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.

 45:008:023 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.

 45:008:024 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?

 45:008:025 But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.

 45:008:026 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.

 45:008:027 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.

 45:008:028 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.

 45:008:029 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.

 45:008:030 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.

 45:008:031 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?

 45:008:032 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

 45:008:033 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.

 45:008:034 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.

 45:008:035 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

 45:008:036 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

 45:008:037 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.

 45:008:038 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,

 45:008:039 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

 45:009:001 I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,

 45:009:002 That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.

 45:009:003 For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:

 45:009:004 Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;

 45:009:005 Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.

 45:009:006 Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:

 45:009:007 Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.

 45:009:008 That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.

 45:009:009 For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.

 45:009:010 And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;

 45:009:011 (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)

 45:009:012 It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.

 45:009:013 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.

 45:009:014 What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.

 45:009:015 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.

 45:009:016 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.

 45:009:017 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.

 45:009:018 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.

 45:009:019 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?

 45:009:020 Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?

 45:009:021 Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?

 45:009:022 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:

 45:009:023 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,

 45:009:024 Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?

 45:009:025 As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.

 45:009:026 And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.

 45:009:027 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:

 45:009:028 For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.

 45:009:029 And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.

 45:009:030 What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.

 45:009:031 But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.

 45:009:032 Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;

 45:009:033 As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.

 45:010:001 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.

 45:010:002 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.

 45:010:003 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.

 45:010:004 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.

 45:010:005 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.

 45:010:006 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)

 45:010:007 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)

 45:010:008 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;

 45:010:009 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

 45:010:010 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

 45:010:011 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.

 45:010:012 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.

 45:010:013 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

 45:010:014 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?

 45:010:015 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!

 45:010:016 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?

 45:010:017 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

 45:010:018 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.

 45:010:019 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.

 45:010:020 But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.

 45:010:021 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.

 45:011:001 I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.

 45:011:002 God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying,

 45:011:003 Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.

 45:011:004 But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.

 45:011:005 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.

 45:011:006 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.

 45:011:007 What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.

 45:011:008 (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.

 45:011:009 And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:

 45:011:010 Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.

 45:011:011 I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.

 45:011:012 Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?

 45:011:013 For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:

 45:011:014 If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.

 45:011:015 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?

 45:011:016 For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.

 45:011:017 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;

 45:011:018 Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.

 45:011:019 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.

 45:011:020 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:

 45:011:021 For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.

 45:011:022 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.

 45:011:023 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.

 45:011:024 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?

 45:011:025 For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.

 45:011:026 And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:

 45:011:027 For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.

 45:011:028 As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.

 45:011:029 For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

 45:011:030 For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:

 45:011:031 Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.

 45:011:032 For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.

 45:011:033 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!

 45:011:034 For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?

 45:011:035 Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?

 45:011:036 For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.

 45:012:001 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.

 45:012:002 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

 45:012:003 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.

 45:012:004 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:

 45:012:005 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.

 45:012:006 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;

 45:012:007 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;

 45:012:008 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.

 45:012:009 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.

 45:012:010 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;

 45:012:011 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;

 45:012:012 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;

 45:012:013 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.

 45:012:014 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.

 45:012:015 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.

 45:012:016 Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.

 45:012:017 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.

 45:012:018 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.

 45:012:019 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.

 45:012:020 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.

 45:012:021 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

 45:013:001 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.

 45:013:002 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.

 45:013:003 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:

 45:013:004 For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.

 45:013:005 Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.

 45:013:006 For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.

 45:013:007 Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.

 45:013:008 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.

 45:013:009 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

 45:013:010 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.

 45:013:011 And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.

 45:013:012 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.

 45:013:013 Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.

 45:013:014 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.

 45:014:001 Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.

 45:014:002 For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.

 45:014:003 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.

 45:014:004 Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.

 45:014:005 One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.

 45:014:006 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.

 45:014:007 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.

 45:014:008 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.

 45:014:009 For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.

 45:014:010 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

 45:014:011 For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.

 45:014:012 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.

 45:014:013 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.

 45:014:014 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.

 45:014:015 But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.

 45:014:016 Let not then your good be evil spoken of:

 45:014:017 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

 45:014:018 For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.

 45:014:019 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.

 45:014:020 For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.

 45:014:021 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.

 45:014:022 Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.

 45:014:023 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.

 45:015:001 We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.

 45:015:002 Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.

 45:015:003 For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.

 45:015:004 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.

 45:015:005 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:

 45:015:006 That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

 45:015:007 Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.

 45:015:008 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:

 45:015:009 And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.

 45:015:010 And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.

 45:015:011 And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.

 45:015:012 And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.

 45:015:013 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.

 45:015:014 And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.

 45:015:015 Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,

 45:015:016 That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.

 45:015:017 I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.

 45:015:018 For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,

 45:015:019 Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

 45:015:020 Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:

 45:015:021 But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.

 45:015:022 For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.

 45:015:023 But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;

 45:015:024 Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.

 45:015:025 But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.

 45:015:026 For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.

 45:015:027 It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.

 45:015:028 When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.

 45:015:029 And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.

 45:015:030 Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;

 45:015:031 That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;

 45:015:032 That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.

 45:015:033 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

 45:016:001 I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:

 45:016:002 That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.

 45:016:003 Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:

 45:016:004 Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.

 45:016:005 Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.

 45:016:006 Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.

 45:016:007 Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.

 45:016:008 Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.

 45:016:009 Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.

 45:016:010 Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household.

 45:016:011 Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.

 45:016:012 Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.

 45:016:013 Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.

 45:016:014 Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.

 45:016:015 Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.

 45:016:016 Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.

 45:016:017 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.

 45:016:018 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.

 45:016:019 For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.

 45:016:020 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

 45:016:021 Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.

 45:016:022 I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.

 45:016:023 Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.

 45:016:024 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

 45:016:025 Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,

 45:016:026 But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:

 45:016:027 To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.

 Book 46 1 Corinthians

 46:001:001 Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,

 46:001:002 Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and our's:

 46:001:003 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

 46:001:004 I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;

 46:001:005 That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;

 46:001:006 Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:

 46:001:007 So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:

 46:001:008 Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

 46:001:009 God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.

 46:001:010 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.

 46:001:011 For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.

 46:001:012 Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.

 46:001:013 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?

 46:001:014 I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;

 46:001:015 Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.

 46:001:016 And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.

 46:001:017 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.

 46:001:018 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.

 46:001:019 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.

 46:001:020 Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?

 46:001:021 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.

 46:001:022 For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:

 46:001:023 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;

 46:001:024 But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.

 46:001:025 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.

 46:001:026 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:

 46:001:027 But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;

 46:001:028 And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:

 46:001:029 That no flesh should glory in his presence.

 46:001:030 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:

 46:001:031 That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

 46:002:001 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.

 46:002:002 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.

 46:002:003 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.

 46:002:004 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:

 46:002:005 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.

 46:002:006 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:

 46:002:007 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:

 46:002:008 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.

 46:002:009 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.

 46:002:010 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.

 46:002:011 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.

 46:002:012 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.

 46:002:013 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.

 46:002:014 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.

 46:002:015 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.

 46:002:016 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.

 46:003:001 And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.

 46:003:002 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.

 46:003:003 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?

 46:003:004 For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?

 46:003:005 Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?

 46:003:006 I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.

 46:003:007 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.

 46:003:008 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.

 46:003:009 For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.

 46:003:010 According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.

 46:003:011 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.

 46:003:012 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;

 46:003:013 Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.

 46:003:014 If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.

 46:003:015 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.

 46:003:016 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?

 46:003:017 If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.

 46:003:018 Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.

 46:003:019 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.

 46:003:020 And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.

 46:003:021 Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's;

 46:003:022 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's;

 46:003:023 And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.

 46:004:001 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.

 46:004:002 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.

 46:004:003 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.

 46:004:004 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.

 46:004:005 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.

 46:004:006 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.

 46:004:007 For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?

 46:004:008 Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.

 46:004:009 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.

 46:004:010 We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.

 46:004:011 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;

 46:004:012 And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:

 46:004:013 Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.

 46:004:014 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.

 46:004:015 For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.

 46:004:016 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.

 46:004:017 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.

 46:004:018 Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.

 46:004:019 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.

 46:004:020 For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.

 46:004:021 What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?

 46:005:001 It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.

 46:005:002 And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.

 46:005:003 For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,

 46:005:004 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,

 46:005:005 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

 46:005:006 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?

 46:005:007 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:

 46:005:008 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

 46:005:009 I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:

 46:005:010 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.

 46:005:011 But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.

 46:005:012 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?

 46:005:013 But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.

 46:006:001 Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?

 46:006:002 Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?

 46:006:003 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?

 46:006:004 If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.

 46:006:005 I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?

 46:006:006 But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.

 46:006:007 Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?

 46:006:008 Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.

 46:006:009 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,

 46:006:010 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

 46:006:011 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.

 46:006:012 All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.

 46:006:013 Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.

 46:006:014 And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.

 46:006:015 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.

 46:006:016 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.

 46:006:017 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.

 46:006:018 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.

 46:006:019 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?

 46:006:020 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.

 46:007:001 Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.

 46:007:002 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.

 46:007:003 Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.

 46:007:004 The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.

 46:007:005 Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.

 46:007:006 But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.

 46:007:007 For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.

 46:007:008 I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.

 46:007:009 But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.

 46:007:010 And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:

 46:007:011 But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.

 46:007:012 But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.

 46:007:013 And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.

 46:007:014 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.

 46:007:015 But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.

 46:007:016 For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?

 46:007:017 But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.

 46:007:018 Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.

 46:007:019 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.

 46:007:020 Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.

 46:007:021 Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.

 46:007:022 For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.

 46:007:023 Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.

 46:007:024 Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.

 46:007:025 Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.

 46:007:026 I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.

 46:007:027 Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.

 46:007:028 But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.

 46:007:029 But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;

 46:007:030 And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;

 46:007:031 And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.

 46:007:032 But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:

 46:007:033 But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.

 46:007:034 There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.

 46:007:035 And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.

 46:007:036 But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.

 46:007:037 Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.

 46:007:038 So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.

 46:007:039 The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.

 46:007:040 But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.

 46:008:001 Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.

 46:008:002 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.

 46:008:003 But if any man love God, the same is known of him.

 46:008:004 As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.

 46:008:005 For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)

 46:008:006 But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.

 46:008:007 Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.

 46:008:008 But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.

 46:008:009 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.

 46:008:010 For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;

 46:008:011 And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?

 46:008:012 But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.

 46:008:013 Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.

 46:009:001 Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?

 46:009:002 If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.

 46:009:003 Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,

 46:009:004 Have we not power to eat and to drink?

 46:009:005 Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?

 46:009:006 Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?

 46:009:007 Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?

 46:009:008 Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?

 46:009:009 For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?

 46:009:010 Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.

 46:009:011 If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?

 46:009:012 If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.

 46:009:013 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?

 46:009:014 Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.

 46:009:015 But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.

 46:009:016 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!

 46:009:017 For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.

 46:009:018 What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.

 46:009:019 For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.

 46:009:020 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;

 46:009:021 To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.

 46:009:022 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.

 46:009:023 And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.

 46:009:024 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.

 46:009:025 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.

 46:009:026 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:

 46:009:027 But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.

 46:010:001 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;

 46:010:002 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;

 46:010:003 And did all eat the same spiritual meat;

 46:010:004 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.

 46:010:005 But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.

 46:010:006 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.

 46:010:007 Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.

 46:010:008 Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.

 46:010:009 Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.

 46:010:010 Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.

 46:010:011 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.

 46:010:012 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.

 46:010:013 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.

 46:010:014 Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.

 46:010:015 I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.

 46:010:016 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?

 46:010:017 For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.

 46:010:018 Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?

 46:010:019 What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?

 46:010:020 But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.

 46:010:021 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.

 46:010:022 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?

 46:010:023 All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.

 46:010:024 Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.

 46:010:025 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:

 46:010:026 For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.

 46:010:027 If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.

 46:010:028 But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:

 46:010:029 Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?

 46:010:030 For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?

 46:010:031 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.

 46:010:032 Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:

 46:010:033 Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.

 46:011:001 Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.

 46:011:002 Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.

 46:011:003 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.

 46:011:004 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.

 46:011:005 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.

 46:011:006 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.

 46:011:007 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.

 46:011:008 For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.

 46:011:009 Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.

 46:011:010 For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.

 46:011:011 Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.

 46:011:012 For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.

 46:011:013 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?

 46:011:014 Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?

 46:011:015 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.

 46:011:016 But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.

 46:011:017 Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.

 46:011:018 For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.

 46:011:019 For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.

 46:011:020 When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.

 46:011:021 For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.

 46:011:022 What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.

 46:011:023 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:

 46:011:024 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.

 46:011:025 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.

 46:011:026 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.

 46:011:027 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

 46:011:028 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.

 46:011:029 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.

 46:011:030 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.

 46:011:031 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.

 46:011:032 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.

 46:011:033 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.

 46:011:034 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.

 46:012:001 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.

 46:012:002 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.

 46:012:003 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.

 46:012:004 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.

 46:012:005 And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.

 46:012:006 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.

 46:012:007 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.

 46:012:008 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;

 46:012:009 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;

 46:012:010 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:

 46:012:011 But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.

 46:012:012 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.

 46:012:013 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.

 46:012:014 For the body is not one member, but many.

 46:012:015 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?

 46:012:016 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?

 46:012:017 If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?

 46:012:018 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.

 46:012:019 And if they were all one member, where were the body?

 46:012:020 But now are they many members, yet but one body.

 46:012:021 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.

 46:012:022 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:

 46:012:023 And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.

 46:012:024 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked.

 46:012:025 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.

 46:012:026 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.

 46:012:027 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

 46:012:028 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.

 46:012:029 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?

 46:012:030 Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?

 46:012:031 But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.

 46:013:001 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

 46:013:002 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.

 46:013:003 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

 46:013:004 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,

 46:013:005 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;

 46:013:006 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;

 46:013:007 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.

 46:013:008 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.

 46:013:009 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.

 46:013:010 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.

 46:013:011 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.

 46:013:012 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.

 46:013:013 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.

 46:014:001 Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.

 46:014:002 For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.

 46:014:003 But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.

 46:014:004 He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.

 46:014:005 I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.

 46:014:006 Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?

 46:014:007 And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?

 46:014:008 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?

 46:014:009 So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.

 46:014:010 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.

 46:014:011 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.

 46:014:012 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.

 46:014:013 Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.

 46:014:014 For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.

 46:014:015 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.

 46:014:016 Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?

 46:014:017 For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.

 46:014:018 I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:

 46:014:019 Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.

 46:014:020 Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.

 46:014:021 In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.

 46:014:022 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.

 46:014:023 If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?

 46:014:024 But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:

 46:014:025 And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.

 46:014:026 How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.

 46:014:027 If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.

 46:014:028 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.

 46:014:029 Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.

 46:014:030 If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.

 46:014:031 For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.

 46:014:032 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

 46:014:033 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.

 46:014:034 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.

 46:014:035 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.

 46:014:036 What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?

 46:014:037 If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.

 46:014:038 But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.

 46:014:039 Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.

 46:014:040 Let all things be done decently and in order.

 46:015:001 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;

 46:015:002 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.

 46:015:003 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;

 46:015:004 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

 46:015:005 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:

 46:015:006 After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.

 46:015:007 After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.

 46:015:008 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.

 46:015:009 For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

 46:015:010 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.

 46:015:011 Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.

 46:015:012 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?

 46:015:013 But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:

 46:015:014 And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.

 46:015:015 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.

 46:015:016 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:

 46:015:017 And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.

 46:015:018 Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.

 46:015:019 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.

 46:015:020 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.

 46:015:021 For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.

 46:015:022 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.

 46:015:023 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.

 46:015:024 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.

 46:015:025 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.

 46:015:026 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.

 46:015:027 For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.

 46:015:028 And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.

 46:015:029 Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?

 46:015:030 And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?

 46:015:031 I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.

 46:015:032 If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.

 46:015:033 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.

 46:015:034 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.

 46:015:035 But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?

 46:015:036 Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:

 46:015:037 And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:

 46:015:038 But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.

 46:015:039 All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.

 46:015:040 There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.

 46:015:041 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.

 46:015:042 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:

 46:015:043 It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:

 46:015:044 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.

 46:015:045 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.

 46:015:046 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.

 46:015:047 The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.

 46:015:048 As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.

 46:015:049 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.

 46:015:050 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.

 46:015:051 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,

 46:015:052 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

 46:015:053 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.

 46:015:054 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

 46:015:055 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?

 46:015:056 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.

 46:015:057 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

 46:015:058 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

 46:016:001 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.

 46:016:002 Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.

 46:016:003 And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.

 46:016:004 And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.

 46:016:005 Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.

 46:016:006 And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.

 46:016:007 For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.

 46:016:008 But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.

 46:016:009 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.

 46:016:010 Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.

 46:016:011 Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.

 46:016:012 As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.

 46:016:013 Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.

 46:016:014 Let all your things be done with charity.

 46:016:015 I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)

 46:016:016 That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.

 46:016:017 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.

 46:016:018 For they have refreshed my spirit and your's: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.

 46:016:019 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.

 46:016:020 All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.

 46:016:021 The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.

 46:016:022 If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.

 46:016:023 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

 46:016:024 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.

 Book 47 2 Corinthians

 47:001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:

 47:001:002 Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

 47:001:003 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;

 47:001:004 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.

 47:001:005 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.

 47:001:006 And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.

 47:001:007 And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.

 47:001:008 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:

 47:001:009 But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:

 47:001:010 Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;

 47:001:011 Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.

 47:001:012 For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.

 47:001:013 For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;

 47:001:014 As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.

 47:001:015 And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;

 47:001:016 And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.

 47:001:017 When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?

 47:001:018 But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.

 47:001:019 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.

 47:001:020 For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.

 47:001:021 Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;

 47:001:022 Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.

 47:001:023 Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.

 47:001:024 Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.

 47:002:001 But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.

 47:002:002 For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?

 47:002:003 And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.

 47:002:004 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.

 47:002:005 But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.

 47:002:006 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.

 47:002:007 So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.

 47:002:008 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.

 47:002:009 For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.

 47:002:010 To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;

 47:002:011 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.

 47:002:012 Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,

 47:002:013 I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.

 47:002:014 Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.

 47:002:015 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:

 47:002:016 To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?

 47:002:017 For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.

 47:003:001 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?

 47:003:002 Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:

 47:003:003 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.

 47:003:004 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:

 47:003:005 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;

 47:003:006 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.

 47:003:007 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:

 47:003:008 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?

 47:003:009 For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.

 47:003:010 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.

 47:003:011 For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.

 47:003:012 Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:

 47:003:013 And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:

 47:003:014 But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.

 47:003:015 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.

 47:003:016 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.

 47:003:017 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.

 47:003:018 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.

 47:004:001 Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;

 47:004:002 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.

 47:004:003 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:

 47:004:004 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.

 47:004:005 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.

 47:004:006 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

 47:004:007 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.

 47:004:008 We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;

 47:004:009 Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;

 47:004:010 Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.

 47:004:011 For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.

 47:004:012 So then death worketh in us, but life in you.

 47:004:013 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;

 47:004:014 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.

 47:004:015 For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.

 47:004:016 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

 47:004:017 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;

 47:004:018 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.

 47:005:001 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

 47:005:002 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:

 47:005:003 If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.

 47:005:004 For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.

 47:005:005 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

 47:005:006 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:

 47:005:007 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)

 47:005:008 We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.

 47:005:009 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.

 47:005:010 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.

 47:005:011 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.

 47:005:012 For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.

 47:005:013 For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.

 47:005:014 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:

 47:005:015 And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.

 47:005:016 Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.

 47:005:017 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

 47:005:018 And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;

 47:005:019 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.

 47:005:020 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.

 47:005:021 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

 47:006:001 We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.

 47:006:002 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)

 47:006:003 Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:

 47:006:004 But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,

 47:006:005 In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;

 47:006:006 By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,

 47:006:007 By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,

 47:006:008 By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;

 47:006:009 As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;

 47:006:010 As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.

 47:006:011 O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.

 47:006:012 Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.

 47:006:013 Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged.

 47:006:014 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?

 47:006:015 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?

 47:006:016 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

 47:006:017 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.

 47:006:018 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.

 47:007:001 Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

 47:007:002 Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.

 47:007:003 I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.

 47:007:004 Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.

 47:007:005 For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.

 47:007:006 Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;

 47:007:007 And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.

 47:007:008 For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.

 47:007:009 Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.

 47:007:010 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.

 47:007:011 For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.

 47:007:012 Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.

 47:007:013 Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.

 47:007:014 For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.

 47:007:015 And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.

 47:007:016 I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.

 47:008:001 Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;

 47:008:002 How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.

 47:008:003 For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;

 47:008:004 Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.

 47:008:005 And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.

 47:008:006 Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.

 47:008:007 Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.

 47:008:008 I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.

 47:008:009 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.

 47:008:010 And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.

 47:008:011 Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.

 47:008:012 For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.

 47:008:013 For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:

 47:008:014 But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:

 47:008:015 As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.

 47:008:016 But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.

 47:008:017 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.

 47:008:018 And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;

 47:008:019 And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:

 47:008:020 Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:

 47:008:021 Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.

 47:008:022 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.

 47:008:023 Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.

 47:008:024 Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.

 47:009:001 For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:

 47:009:002 For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.

 47:009:003 Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:

 47:009:004 Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.

 47:009:005 Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.

 47:009:006 But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.

 47:009:007 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.

 47:009:008 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:

 47:009:009 (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.

 47:009:010 Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)

 47:009:011 Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.

 47:009:012 For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;

 47:009:013 Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;

 47:009:014 And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.

 47:009:015 Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.

 47:010:001 Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:

 47:010:002 But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.

 47:010:003 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:

 47:010:004 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)

 47:010:005 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;

 47:010:006 And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.

 47:010:007 Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.

 47:010:008 For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:

 47:010:009 That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.

 47:010:010 For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.

 47:010:011 Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.

 47:010:012 For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.

 47:010:013 But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.

 47:010:014 For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:

 47:010:015 Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,

 47:010:016 To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.

 47:010:017 But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

 47:010:018 For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.

 47:011:001 Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.

 47:011:002 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.

 47:011:003 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.

 47:011:004 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.

 47:011:005 For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.

 47:011:006 But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.

 47:011:007 Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?

 47:011:008 I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.

 47:011:009 And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.

 47:011:010 As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.

 47:011:011 Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.

 47:011:012 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.

 47:011:013 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.

 47:011:014 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.

 47:011:015 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.

 47:011:016 I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.

 47:011:017 That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.

 47:011:018 Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.

 47:011:019 For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.

 47:011:020 For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.

 47:011:021 I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.

 47:011:022 Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.

 47:011:023 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.

 47:011:024 Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.

 47:011:025 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;

 47:011:026 In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;

 47:011:027 In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

 47:011:028 Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.

 47:011:029 Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?

 47:011:030 If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.

 47:011:031 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.

 47:011:032 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:

 47:011:033 And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.

 47:012:001 It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.

 47:012:002 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.

 47:012:003 And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)

 47:012:004 How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.

 47:012:005 Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.

 47:012:006 For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.

 47:012:007 And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.

 47:012:008 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.

 47:012:009 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.

 47:012:010 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.

 47:012:011 I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.

 47:012:012 Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.

 47:012:013 For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.

 47:012:014 Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.

 47:012:015 And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.

 47:012:016 But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.

 47:012:017 Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?

 47:012:018 I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?

 47:012:019 Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.

 47:012:020 For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:

 47:012:021 And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.

 47:013:001 This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.

 47:013:002 I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:

 47:013:003 Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.

 47:013:004 For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.

 47:013:005 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?

 47:013:006 But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.

 47:013:007 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.

 47:013:008 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.

 47:013:009 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.

 47:013:010 Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.

 47:013:011 Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.

 47:013:012 Greet one another with an holy kiss.

 47:013:013 All the saints salute you.

 47:013:014 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.

 Book 48 Galatians

 48:001:001 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)

 48:001:002 And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:

 48:001:003 Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,

 48:001:004 Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:

 48:001:005 To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

 48:001:006 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:

 48:001:007 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.

 48:001:008 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.

 48:001:009 As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.

 48:001:010 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.

 48:001:011 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.

 48:001:012 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

 48:001:013 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:

 48:001:014 And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.

 48:001:015 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,

 48:001:016 To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:

 48:001:017 Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.

 48:001:018 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.

 48:001:019 But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.

 48:001:020 Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.

 48:001:021 Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;

 48:001:022 And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:

 48:001:023 But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.

 48:001:024 And they glorified God in me.

 48:002:001 Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.

 48:002:002 And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.

 48:002:003 But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:

 48:002:004 And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:

 48:002:005 To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.

 48:002:006 But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:

 48:002:007 But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;

 48:002:008 (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)

 48:002:009 And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.

 48:002:010 Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.

 48:002:011 But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.

 48:002:012 For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.

 48:002:013 And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.

 48:002:014 But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?

 48:002:015 We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,

 48:002:016 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.

 48:002:017 But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.

 48:002:018 For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.

 48:002:019 For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.

 48:002:020 I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.

 48:002:021 I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.

 48:003:001 O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?

 48:003:002 This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

 48:003:003 Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?

 48:003:004 Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.

 48:003:005 He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

 48:003:006 Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.

 48:003:007 Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.

 48:003:008 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.

 48:003:009 So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.

 48:003:010 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.

 48:003:011 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.

 48:003:012 And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.

 48:003:013 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:

 48:003:014 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

 48:003:015 Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.

 48:003:016 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.

 48:003:017 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.

 48:003:018 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.

 48:003:019 Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.

 48:003:020 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.

 48:003:021 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.

 48:003:022 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.

 48:003:023 But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.

 48:003:024 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

 48:003:025 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.

 48:003:026 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

 48:003:027 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.

 48:003:028 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

 48:003:029 And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.

 48:004:001 Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;

 48:004:002 But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.

 48:004:003 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:

 48:004:004 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,

 48:004:005 To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.

 48:004:006 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

 48:004:007 Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.

 48:004:008 Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.

 48:004:009 But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?

 48:004:010 Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.

 48:004:011 I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.

 48:004:012 Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.

 48:004:013 Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.

 48:004:014 And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.

 48:004:015 Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.

 48:004:016 Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?

 48:004:017 They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.

 48:004:018 But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.

 48:004:019 My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,

 48:004:020 I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.

 48:004:021 Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?

 48:004:022 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.

 48:004:023 But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.

 48:004:024 Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.

 48:004:025 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.

 48:004:026 But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.

 48:004:027 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.

 48:004:028 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.

 48:004:029 But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.

 48:004:030 Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.

 48:004:031 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.

 48:005:001 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

 48:005:002 Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.

 48:005:003 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.

 48:005:004 Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.

 48:005:005 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.

 48:005:006 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.

 48:005:007 Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?

 48:005:008 This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.

 48:005:009 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

 48:005:010 I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.

 48:005:011 And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.

 48:005:012 I would they were even cut off which trouble you.

 48:005:013 For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.

 48:005:014 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

 48:005:015 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.

 48:005:016 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.

 48:005:017 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.

 48:005:018 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.

 48:005:019 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,

 48:005:020 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,

 48:005:021 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

 48:005:022 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,

 48:005:023 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.

 48:005:024 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.

 48:005:025 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

 48:005:026 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.

 48:006:001 Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.

 48:006:002 Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.

 48:006:003 For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.

 48:006:004 But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.

 48:006:005 For every man shall bear his own burden.

 48:006:006 Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.

 48:006:007 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.

 48:006:008 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.

 48:006:009 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.

 48:006:010 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

 48:006:011 Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.

 48:006:012 As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.

 48:006:013 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.

 48:006:014 But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.

 48:006:015 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

 48:006:016 And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.

 48:006:017 From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.

 48:006:018 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

 Book 49 Ephesians

 49:001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:

 49:001:002 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

 49:001:003 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:

 49:001:004 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:

 49:001:005 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,

 49:001:006 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.

 49:001:007 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;

 49:001:008 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;

 49:001:009 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:

 49:001:010 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:

 49:001:011 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:

 49:001:012 That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.

 49:001:013 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,

 49:001:014 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.

 49:001:015 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,

 49:001:016 Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;

 49:001:017 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:

 49:001:018 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,

 49:001:019 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,

 49:001:020 Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,

 49:001:021 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:

 49:001:022 And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,

 49:001:023 Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.

 49:002:001 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;

 49:002:002 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:

 49:002:003 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.

 49:002:004 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,

 49:002:005 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)

 49:002:006 And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:

 49:002:007 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.

 49:002:008 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:

 49:002:009 Not of works, lest any man should boast.

 49:002:010 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.

 49:002:011 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;

 49:002:012 That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:

 49:002:013 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.

 49:002:014 For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;

 49:002:015 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;

 49:002:016 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:

 49:002:017 And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.

 49:002:018 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.

 49:002:019 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;

 49:002:020 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;

 49:002:021 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:

 49:002:022 In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.

 49:003:001 For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,

 49:003:002 If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:

 49:003:003 How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,

 49:003:004 Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)

 49:003:005 Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;

 49:003:006 That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:

 49:003:007 Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.

 49:003:008 Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;

 49:003:009 And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:

 49:003:010 To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,

 49:003:011 According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:

 49:003:012 In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.

 49:003:013 Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.

 49:003:014 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

 49:003:015 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,

 49:003:016 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;

 49:003:017 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,

 49:003:018 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;

 49:003:019 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.

 49:003:020 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,

 49:003:021 Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.

 49:004:001 I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,

 49:004:002 With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;

 49:004:003 Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

 49:004:004 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;

 49:004:005 One Lord, one faith, one baptism,

 49:004:006 One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.

 49:004:007 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.

 49:004:008 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.

 49:004:009 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?

 49:004:010 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)

 49:004:011 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;

 49:004:012 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:

 49:004:013 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

 49:004:014 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;

 49:004:015 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:

 49:004:016 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.

 49:004:017 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,

 49:004:018 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:

 49:004:019 Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.

 49:004:020 But ye have not so learned Christ;

 49:004:021 If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:

 49:004:022 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;

 49:004:023 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;

 49:004:024 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.

 49:004:025 Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.

 49:004:026 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:

 49:004:027 Neither give place to the devil.

 49:004:028 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.

 49:004:029 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.

 49:004:030 And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.

 49:004:031 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:

 49:004:032 And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.

 49:005:001 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;

 49:005:002 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.

 49:005:003 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;

 49:005:004 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.

 49:005:005 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.

 49:005:006 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.

 49:005:007 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

 49:005:008 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:

 49:005:009 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)

 49:005:010 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

 49:005:011 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.

 49:005:012 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.

 49:005:013 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.

 49:005:014 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.

 49:005:015 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,

 49:005:016 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

 49:005:017 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.

 49:005:018 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;

 49:005:019 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;

 49:005:020 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;

 49:005:021 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

 49:005:022 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.

 49:005:023 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.

 49:005:024 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.

 49:005:025 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;

 49:005:026 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,

 49:005:027 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.

 49:005:028 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.

 49:005:029 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:

 49:005:030 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.

 49:005:031 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.

 49:005:032 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.

 49:005:033 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.

 49:006:001 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.

 49:006:002 Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;

 49:006:003 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.

 49:006:004 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

 49:006:005 Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;

 49:006:006 Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;

 49:006:007 With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:

 49:006:008 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.

 49:006:009 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.

 49:006:010 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.

 49:006:011 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.

 49:006:012 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

 49:006:013 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

 49:006:014 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;

 49:006:015 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;

 49:006:016 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

 49:006:017 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:

 49:006:018 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;

 49:006:019 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,

 49:006:020 For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.

 49:006:021 But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:

 49:006:022 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.

 49:006:023 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

 49:006:024 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.

 Book 50 Philippians

 50:001:001 Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:

 50:001:002 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

 50:001:003 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,

 50:001:004 Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,

 50:001:005 For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;

 50:001:006 Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:

 50:001:007 Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.

 50:001:008 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.

 50:001:009 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;

 50:001:010 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.

 50:001:011 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.

 50:001:012 But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;

 50:001:013 So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;

 50:001:014 And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.

 50:001:015 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:

 50:001:016 The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:

 50:001:017 But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.

 50:001:018 What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.

 50:001:019 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

 50:001:020 According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.

 50:001:021 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

 50:001:022 But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.

 50:001:023 For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:

 50:001:024 Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.

 50:001:025 And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;

 50:001:026 That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.

 50:001:027 Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;

 50:001:028 And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.

 50:001:029 For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;

 50:001:030 Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.

 50:002:001 If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,

 50:002:002 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.

 50:002:003 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.

 50:002:004 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.

 50:002:005 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:

 50:002:006 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:

 50:002:007 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:

 50:002:008 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

 50:002:009 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:

 50:002:010 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;

 50:002:011 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

 50:002:012 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.

 50:002:013 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.

 50:002:014 Do all things without murmurings and disputings:

 50:002:015 That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;

 50:002:016 Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.

 50:002:017 Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.

 50:002:018 For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.

 50:002:019 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.

 50:002:020 For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.

 50:002:021 For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.

 50:002:022 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.

 50:002:023 Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.

 50:002:024 But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.

 50:002:025 Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.

 50:002:026 For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.

 50:002:027 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.

 50:002:028 I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.

 50:002:029 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:

 50:002:030 Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.

 50:003:001 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.

 50:003:002 Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.

 50:003:003 For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.

 50:003:004 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:

 50:003:005 Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;

 50:003:006 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.

 50:003:007 But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.

 50:003:008 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,

 50:003:009 And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:

 50:003:010 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;

 50:003:011 If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.

 50:003:012 Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.

 50:003:013 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,

 50:003:014 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

 50:003:015 Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.

 50:003:016 Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.

 50:003:017 Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.

 50:003:018 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:

 50:003:019 Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)

 50:003:020 For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:

 50:003:021 Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.

 50:004:001 Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.

 50:004:002 I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.

 50:004:003 And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.

 50:004:004 Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.

 50:004:005 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.

 50:004:006 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.

 50:004:007 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

 50:004:008 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.

 50:004:009 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.

 50:004:010 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.

 50:004:011 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.

 50:004:012 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.

 50:004:013 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.

 50:004:014 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.

 50:004:015 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.

 50:004:016 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.

 50:004:017 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.

 50:004:018 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.

 50:004:019 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

 50:004:020 Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

 50:004:021 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.

 50:004:022 All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.

 50:004:023 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

 Book 51 Colossians

 51:001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,

 51:001:002 To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

 51:001:003 We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,

 51:001:004 Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,

 51:001:005 For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;

 51:001:006 Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:

 51:001:007 As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;

 51:001:008 Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.

 51:001:009 For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;

 51:001:010 That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;

 51:001:011 Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;

 51:001:012 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:

 51:001:013 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:

 51:001:014 In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:

 51:001:015 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:

 51:001:016 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:

 51:001:017 And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.

 51:001:018 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.

 51:001:019 For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;

 51:001:020 And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.

 51:001:021 And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled

 51:001:022 In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:

 51:001:023 If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;

 51:001:024 Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:

 51:001:025 Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;

 51:001:026 Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:

 51:001:027 To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:

 51:001:028 Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:

 51:001:029 Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.

 51:002:001 For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;

 51:002:002 That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;

 51:002:003 In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

 51:002:004 And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.

 51:002:005 For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.

 51:002:006 As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:

 51:002:007 Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.

 51:002:008 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.

 51:002:009 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.

 51:002:010 And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:

 51:002:011 In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:

 51:002:012 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.

 51:002:013 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;

 51:002:014 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;

 51:002:015 And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.

 51:002:016 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:

 51:002:017 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.

 51:002:018 Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,

 51:002:019 And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.

 51:002:020 Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,

 51:002:021 (Touch not; taste not; handle not;

 51:002:022 Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?

 51:002:023 Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.

 51:003:001 If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.

 51:003:002 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.

 51:003:003 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.

 51:003:004 When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.

 51:003:005 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:

 51:003:006 For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:

 51:003:007 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.

 51:003:008 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.

 51:003:009 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;

 51:003:010 And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:

 51:003:011 Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.

 51:003:012 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;

 51:003:013 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.

 51:003:014 And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.

 51:003:015 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.

 51:003:016 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

 51:003:017 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

 51:003:018 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.

 51:003:019 Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.

 51:003:020 Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.

 51:003:021 Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.

 51:003:022 Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;

 51:003:023 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;

 51:003:024 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.

 51:003:025 But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.

 51:004:001 Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.

 51:004:002 Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;

 51:004:003 Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:

 51:004:004 That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.

 51:004:005 Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.

 51:004:006 Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.

 51:004:007 All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:

 51:004:008 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;

 51:004:009 With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here.

 51:004:010 Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)

 51:004:011 And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.

 51:004:012 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

 51:004:013 For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.

 51:004:014 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.

 51:004:015 Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.

 51:004:016 And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.

 51:004:017 And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.

 51:004:018 The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.

 Book 52 1 Thessalonians

 52:001:001 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

 52:001:002 We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;

 52:001:003 Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;

 52:001:004 Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.

 52:001:005 For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.

 52:001:006 And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.

 52:001:007 So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.

 52:001:008 For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.

 52:001:009 For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;

 52:001:010 And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.

 52:002:001 For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:

 52:002:002 But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.

 52:002:003 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:

 52:002:004 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.

 52:002:005 For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:

 52:002:006 Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.

 52:002:007 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:

 52:002:008 So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.

 52:002:009 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.

 52:002:010 Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:

 52:002:011 As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,

 52:002:012 That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.

 52:002:013 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.

 52:002:014 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:

 52:002:015 Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:

 52:002:016 Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.

 52:002:017 But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.

 52:002:018 Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.

 52:002:019 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?

 52:002:020 For ye are our glory and joy.

 52:003:001 Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;

 52:003:002 And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:

 52:003:003 That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.

 52:003:004 For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.

 52:003:005 For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.

 52:003:006 But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:

 52:003:007 Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:

 52:003:008 For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.

 52:003:009 For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;

 52:003:010 Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?

 52:003:011 Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.

 52:003:012 And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:

 52:003:013 To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.

 52:004:001 Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.

 52:004:002 For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

 52:004:003 For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:

 52:004:004 That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;

 52:004:005 Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:

 52:004:006 That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.

 52:004:007 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.

 52:004:008 He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.

 52:004:009 But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.

 52:004:010 And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;

 52:004:011 And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;

 52:004:012 That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.

 52:004:013 But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.

 52:004:014 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.

 52:004:015 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.

 52:004:016 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:

 52:004:017 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

 52:004:018 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

 52:005:001 But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.

 52:005:002 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.

 52:005:003 For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.

 52:005:004 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.

 52:005:005 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.

 52:005:006 Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.

 52:005:007 For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.

 52:005:008 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.

 52:005:009 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,

 52:005:010 Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.

 52:005:011 Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.

 52:005:012 And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;

 52:005:013 And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.

 52:005:014 Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.

 52:005:015 See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.

 52:005:016 Rejoice evermore.

 52:005:017 Pray without ceasing.

 52:005:018 In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.

 52:005:019 Quench not the Spirit.

 52:005:020 Despise not prophesyings.

 52:005:021 Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.

 52:005:022 Abstain from all appearance of evil.

 52:005:023 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

 52:005:024 Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.

 52:005:025 Brethren, pray for us.

 52:005:026 Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

 52:005:027 I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.

 52:005:028 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

 Book 53 2 Thessalonians

 53:001:001 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

 53:001:002 Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

 53:001:003 We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;

 53:001:004 So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:

 53:001:005 Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:

 53:001:006 Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;

 53:001:007 And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,

 53:001:008 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:

 53:001:009 Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;

 53:001:010 When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.

 53:001:011 Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:

 53:001:012 That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

 53:002:001 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,

 53:002:002 That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.

 53:002:003 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;

 53:002:004 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.

 53:002:005 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?

 53:002:006 And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.

 53:002:007 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.

 53:002:008 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:

 53:002:009 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,

 53:002:010 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.

 53:002:011 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:

 53:002:012 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.

 53:002:013 But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:

 53:002:014 Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

 53:002:015 Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.

 53:002:016 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,

 53:002:017 Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.

 53:003:001 Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:

 53:003:002 And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.

 53:003:003 But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.

 53:003:004 And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.

 53:003:005 And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.

 53:003:006 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.

 53:003:007 For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;

 53:003:008 Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:

 53:003:009 Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.

 53:003:010 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.

 53:003:011 For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.

 53:003:012 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.

 53:003:013 But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.

 53:003:014 And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.

 53:003:015 Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

 53:003:016 Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.

 53:003:017 The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.

 53:003:018 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

 Book 54 1 Timothy

 54:001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;

 54:001:002 Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.

 54:001:003 As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,

 54:001:004 Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.

 54:001:005 Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:

 54:001:006 From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;

 54:001:007 Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.

 54:001:008 But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;

 54:001:009 Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,

 54:001:010 For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;

 54:001:011 According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.

 54:001:012 And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;

 54:001:013 Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.

 54:001:014 And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

 54:001:015 This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.

 54:001:016 Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.

 54:001:017 Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

 54:001:018 This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;

 54:001:019 Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:

 54:001:020 Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.

 54:002:001 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;

 54:002:002 For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.

 54:002:003 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;

 54:002:004 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

 54:002:005 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;

 54:002:006 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.

 54:002:007 Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

 54:002:008 I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.

 54:002:009 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;

 54:002:010 But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.

 54:002:011 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.

 54:002:012 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.

 54:002:013 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.

 54:002:014 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.

 54:002:015 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.

 54:003:001 This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.

 54:003:002 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;

 54:003:003 Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;

 54:003:004 One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;

 54:003:005 (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)

 54:003:006 Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.

 54:003:007 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

 54:003:008 Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;

 54:003:009 Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.

 54:003:010 And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.

 54:003:011 Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.

 54:003:012 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.

 54:003:013 For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.

 54:003:014 These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:

 54:003:015 But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.

 54:003:016 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.

 54:004:001 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;

 54:004:002 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;

 54:004:003 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.

 54:004:004 For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:

 54:004:005 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

 54:004:006 If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.

 54:004:007 But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.

 54:004:008 For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.

 54:004:009 This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.

 54:004:010 For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.

 54:004:011 These things command and teach.

 54:004:012 Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.

 54:004:013 Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.

 54:004:014 Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.

 54:004:015 Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.

 54:004:016 Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.

 54:005:001 Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;

 54:005:002 The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.

 54:005:003 Honour widows that are widows indeed.

 54:005:004 But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.

 54:005:005 Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.

 54:005:006 But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.

 54:005:007 And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.

 54:005:008 But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.

 54:005:009 Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man.

 54:005:010 Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.

 54:005:011 But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;

 54:005:012 Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.

 54:005:013 And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.

 54:005:014 I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.

 54:005:015 For some are already turned aside after Satan.

 54:005:016 If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.

 54:005:017 Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.

 54:005:018 For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.

 54:005:019 Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.

 54:005:020 Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.

 54:005:021 I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.

 54:005:022 Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure.

 54:005:023 Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities.

 54:005:024 Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.

 54:005:025 Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.

 54:006:001 Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.

 54:006:002 And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.

 54:006:003 If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;

 54:006:004 He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,

 54:006:005 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.

 54:006:006 But godliness with contentment is great gain.

 54:006:007 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.

 54:006:008 And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.

 54:006:009 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.

 54:006:010 For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

 54:006:011 But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.

 54:006:012 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.

 54:006:013 I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;

 54:006:014 That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:

 54:006:015 Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;

 54:006:016 Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.

 54:006:017 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;

 54:006:018 That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;

 54:006:019 Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.

 54:006:020 O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:

 54:006:021 Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.

 Book 55 2 Timothy

 55:001:001 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,

 55:001:002 To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

 55:001:003 I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;

 55:001:004 Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;

 55:001:005 When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.

 55:001:006 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.

 55:001:007 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.

 55:001:008 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;

 55:001:009 Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,

 55:001:010 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:

 55:001:011 Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.

 55:001:012 For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.

 55:001:013 Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

 55:001:014 That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.

 55:001:015 This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.

 55:001:016 The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:

 55:001:017 But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.

 55:001:018 The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.

 55:002:001 Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

 55:002:002 And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.

 55:002:003 Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

 55:002:004 No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

 55:002:005 And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.

 55:002:006 The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.

 55:002:007 Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.

 55:002:008 Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:

 55:002:009 Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.

 55:002:010 Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

 55:002:011 It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:

 55:002:012 If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:

 55:002:013 If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.

 55:002:014 Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.

 55:002:015 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

 55:002:016 But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.

 55:002:017 And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;

 55:002:018 Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.

 55:002:019 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.

 55:002:020 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.

 55:002:021 If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.

 55:002:022 Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

 55:002:023 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.

 55:002:024 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,

 55:002:025 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;

 55:002:026 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.

 55:003:001 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

 55:003:002 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

 55:003:003 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,

 55:003:004 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;

 55:003:005 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.

 55:003:006 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,

 55:003:007 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

 55:003:008 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.

 55:003:009 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as their's also was.

 55:003:010 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,

 55:003:011 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.

 55:003:012 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

 55:003:013 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.

 55:003:014 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;

 55:003:015 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

 55:003:016 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:

 55:003:017 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.

 55:004:001 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;

 55:004:002 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.

 55:004:003 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;

 55:004:004 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.

 55:004:005 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.

 55:004:006 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.

 55:004:007 I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:

 55:004:008 Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.

 55:004:009 Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:

 55:004:010 For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.

 55:004:011 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.

 55:004:012 And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.

 55:004:013 The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.

 55:004:014 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:

 55:004:015 Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.

 55:004:016 At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.

 55:004:017 Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

 55:004:018 And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

 55:004:019 Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.

 55:004:020 Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.

 55:004:021 Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.

 55:004:022 The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.

 Book 56 Titus

 56:001:001 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;

 56:001:002 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;

 56:001:003 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;

 56:001:004 To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.

 56:001:005 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:

 56:001:006 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.

 56:001:007 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;

 56:001:008 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;

 56:001:009 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.

 56:001:010 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:

 56:001:011 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.

 56:001:012 One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.

 56:001:013 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;

 56:001:014 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.

 56:001:015 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.

 56:001:016 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.

 56:002:001 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:

 56:002:002 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.

 56:002:003 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;

 56:002:004 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,

 56:002:005 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

 56:002:006 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.

 56:002:007 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,

 56:002:008 Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.

 56:002:009 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;

 56:002:010 Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

 56:002:011 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,

 56:002:012 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;

 56:002:013 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

 56:002:014 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.

 56:002:015 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.

 56:003:001 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,

 56:003:002 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.

 56:003:003 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.

 56:003:004 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,

 56:003:005 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;

 56:003:006 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;

 56:003:007 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

 56:003:008 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.

 56:003:009 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.

 56:003:010 A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;

 56:003:011 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.

 56:003:012 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.

 56:003:013 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.

 56:003:014 And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.

 56:003:015 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.

 Book 57 Philemon

 57:001:001 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,

 57:001:002 And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:

 57:001:003 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

 57:001:004 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,

 57:001:005 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;

 57:001:006 That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.

 57:001:007 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.

 57:001:008 Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,

 57:001:009 Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

 57:001:010 I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:

 57:001:011 Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:

 57:001:012 Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:

 57:001:013 Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:

 57:001:014 But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.

 57:001:015 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;

 57:001:016 Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?

 57:001:017 If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.

 57:001:018 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;

 57:001:019 I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.

 57:001:020 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.

 57:001:021 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.

 57:001:022 But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.

 57:001:023 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;

 57:001:024 Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.

 57:001:025 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

 Book 58 Hebrews

 58:001:001 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,

 58:001:002 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;

 58:001:003 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:

 58:001:004 Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.

 58:001:005 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?

 58:001:006 And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.

 58:001:007 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.

 58:001:008 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.

 58:001:009 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.

 58:001:010 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:

 58:001:011 They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;

 58:001:012 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.

 58:001:013 But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?

 58:001:014 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?

 58:002:001 Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.

 58:002:002 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;

 58:002:003 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;

 58:002:004 God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?

 58:002:005 For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.

 58:002:006 But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?

 58:002:007 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:

 58:002:008 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.

 58:002:009 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.

 58:002:010 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.

 58:002:011 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,

 58:002:012 Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.

 58:002:013 And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.

 58:002:014 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;

 58:002:015 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.

 58:002:016 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.

 58:002:017 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.

 58:002:018 For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.

 58:003:001 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;

 58:003:002 Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.

 58:003:003 For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.

 58:003:004 For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.

 58:003:005 And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;

 58:003:006 But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.

 58:003:007 Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,

 58:003:008 Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:

 58:003:009 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.

 58:003:010 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.

 58:003:011 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)

 58:003:012 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.

 58:003:013 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

 58:003:014 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;

 58:003:015 While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.

 58:003:016 For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.

 58:003:017 But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?

 58:003:018 And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?

 58:003:019 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.

 58:004:001 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.

 58:004:002 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.

 58:004:003 For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.

 58:004:004 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.

 58:004:005 And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.

 58:004:006 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:

 58:004:007 Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.

 58:004:008 For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.

 58:004:009 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.

 58:004:010 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.

 58:004:011 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.

 58:004:012 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

 58:004:013 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.

 58:004:014 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.

 58:004:015 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.

 58:004:016 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

 58:005:001 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:

 58:005:002 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.

 58:005:003 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.

 58:005:004 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.

 58:005:005 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.

 58:005:006 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.

 58:005:007 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;

 58:005:008 Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;

 58:005:009 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;

 58:005:010 Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.

 58:005:011 Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.

 58:005:012 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.

 58:005:013 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.

 58:005:014 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.

 58:006:001 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,

 58:006:002 Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.

 58:006:003 And this will we do, if God permit.

 58:006:004 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,

 58:006:005 And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,

 58:006:006 If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.

 58:006:007 For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:

 58:006:008 But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.

 58:006:009 But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.

 58:006:010 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.

 58:006:011 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:

 58:006:012 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.

 58:006:013 For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,

 58:006:014 Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.

 58:006:015 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.

 58:006:016 For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.

 58:006:017 Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:

 58:006:018 That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:

 58:006:019 Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;

 58:006:020 Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.

 58:007:001 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;

 58:007:002 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;

 58:007:003 Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.

 58:007:004 Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.

 58:007:005 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:

 58:007:006 But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.

 58:007:007 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.

 58:007:008 And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.

 58:007:009 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.

 58:007:010 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.

 58:007:011 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?

 58:007:012 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.

 58:007:013 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.

 58:007:014 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.

 58:007:015 And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,

 58:007:016 Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.

 58:007:017 For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.

 58:007:018 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.

 58:007:019 For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.

 58:007:020 And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:

 58:007:021 (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)

 58:007:022 By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.

 58:007:023 And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:

 58:007:024 But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.

 58:007:025 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.

 58:007:026 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;

 58:007:027 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.

 58:007:028 For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.

 58:008:001 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;

 58:008:002 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.

 58:008:003 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.

 58:008:004 For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:

 58:008:005 Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.

 58:008:006 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.

 58:008:007 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.

 58:008:008 For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:

 58:008:009 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.

 58:008:010 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:

 58:008:011 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.

 58:008:012 For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.

 58:008:013 In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.

 58:009:001 Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.

 58:009:002 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.

 58:009:003 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;

 58:009:004 Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;

 58:009:005 And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.

 58:009:006 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.

 58:009:007 But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:

 58:009:008 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:

 58:009:009 Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;

 58:009:010 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.

 58:009:011 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;

 58:009:012 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.

 58:009:013 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:

 58:009:014 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

 58:009:015 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.

 58:009:016 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.

 58:009:017 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.

 58:009:018 Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.

 58:009:019 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,

 58:009:020 Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.

 58:009:021 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.

 58:009:022 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.

 58:009:023 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.

 58:009:024 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:

 58:009:025 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;

 58:009:026 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.

 58:009:027 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:

 58:009:028 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.

 58:010:001 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.

 58:010:002 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.

 58:010:003 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.

 58:010:004 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.

 58:010:005 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:

 58:010:006 In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.

 58:010:007 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.

 58:010:008 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;

 58:010:009 Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.

 58:010:010 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

 58:010:011 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:

 58:010:012 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;

 58:010:013 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.

 58:010:014 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.

 58:010:015 Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,

 58:010:016 This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;

 58:010:017 And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.

 58:010:018 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.

 58:010:019 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,

 58:010:020 By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;

 58:010:021 And having an high priest over the house of God;

 58:010:022 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.

 58:010:023 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)

 58:010:024 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:

 58:010:025 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.

 58:010:026 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,

 58:010:027 But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.

 58:010:028 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:

 58:010:029 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?

 58:010:030 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.

 58:010:031 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

 58:010:032 But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;

 58:010:033 Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.

 58:010:034 For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.

 58:010:035 Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.

 58:010:036 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.

 58:010:037 For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.

 58:010:038 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.

 58:010:039 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.

 58:011:001 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.

 58:011:002 For by it the elders obtained a good report.

 58:011:003 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.

 58:011:004 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.

 58:011:005 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.

 58:011:006 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

 58:011:007 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.

 58:011:008 By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.

 58:011:009 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:

 58:011:010 For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.

 58:011:011 Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.

 58:011:012 Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.

 58:011:013 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.

 58:011:014 For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.

 58:011:015 And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.

 58:011:016 But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.

 58:011:017 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,

 58:011:018 Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:

 58:011:019 Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.

 58:011:020 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.

 58:011:021 By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.

 58:011:022 By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.

 58:011:023 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.

 58:011:024 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;

 58:011:025 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;

 58:011:026 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.

 58:011:027 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.

 58:011:028 Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.

 58:011:029 By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.

 58:011:030 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.

 58:011:031 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.

 58:011:032 And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:

 58:011:033 Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.

 58:011:034 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.

 58:011:035 Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:

 58:011:036 And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:

 58:011:037 They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;

 58:011:038 (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.

 58:011:039 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:

 58:011:040 God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.

 58:012:001 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,

 58:012:002 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

 58:012:003 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.

 58:012:004 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.

 58:012:005 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:

 58:012:006 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.

 58:012:007 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?

 58:012:008 But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.

 58:012:009 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?

 58:012:010 For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.

 58:012:011 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.

 58:012:012 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;

 58:012:013 And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.

 58:012:014 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:

 58:012:015 Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;

 58:012:016 Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.

 58:012:017 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.

 58:012:018 For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,

 58:012:019 And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:

 58:012:020 (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:

 58:012:021 And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)

 58:012:022 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,

 58:012:023 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,

 58:012:024 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.

 58:012:025 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:

 58:012:026 Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.

 58:012:027 And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.

 58:012:028 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:

 58:012:029 For our God is a consuming fire.

 58:013:001 Let brotherly love continue.

 58:013:002 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.

 58:013:003 Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.

 58:013:004 Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.

 58:013:005 Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.

 58:013:006 So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

 58:013:007 Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.

 58:013:008 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.

 58:013:009 Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.

 58:013:010 We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.

 58:013:011 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.

 58:013:012 Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.

 58:013:013 Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.

 58:013:014 For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.

 58:013:015 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.

 58:013:016 But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.

 58:013:017 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.

 58:013:018 Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.

 58:013:019 But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.

 58:013:020 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,

 58:013:021 Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

 58:013:022 And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.

 58:013:023 Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.

 58:013:024 Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.

 58:013:025 Grace be with you all. Amen.

 Book 59 James

 59:001:001 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.

 59:001:002 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;

 59:001:003 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.

 59:001:004 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.

 59:001:005 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

 59:001:006 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.

 59:001:007 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.

 59:001:008 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.

 59:001:009 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:

 59:001:010 But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.

 59:001:011 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.

 59:001:012 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.

 59:001:013 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:

 59:001:014 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.

 59:001:015 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.

 59:001:016 Do not err, my beloved brethren.

 59:001:017 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.

 59:001:018 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.

 59:001:019 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:

 59:001:020 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.

 59:001:021 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.

 59:001:022 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.

 59:001:023 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:

 59:001:024 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.

 59:001:025 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.

 59:001:026 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.

 59:001:027 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.

 59:002:001 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.

 59:002:002 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;

 59:002:003 And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:

 59:002:004 Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?

 59:002:005 Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?

 59:002:006 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?

 59:002:007 Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?

 59:002:008 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:

 59:002:009 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.

 59:002:010 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.

 59:002:011 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.

 59:002:012 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.

 59:002:013 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.

 59:002:014 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?

 59:002:015 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,

 59:002:016 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?

 59:002:017 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.

 59:002:018 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.

 59:002:019 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.

 59:002:020 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?

 59:002:021 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?

 59:002:022 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?

 59:002:023 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.

 59:002:024 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.

 59:002:025 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?

 59:002:026 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.

 59:003:001 My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.

 59:003:002 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.

 59:003:003 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.

 59:003:004 Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.

 59:003:005 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!

 59:003:006 And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.

 59:003:007 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:

 59:003:008 But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.

 59:003:009 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.

 59:003:010 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.

 59:003:011 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?

 59:003:012 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.

 59:003:013 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.

 59:003:014 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.

 59:003:015 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.

 59:003:016 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.

 59:003:017 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

 59:003:018 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.

 59:004:001 From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?

 59:004:002 Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.

 59:004:003 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.

 59:004:004 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.

 59:004:005 Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?

 59:004:006 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.

 59:004:007 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

 59:004:008 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.

 59:004:009 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.

 59:004:010 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.

 59:004:011 Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.

 59:004:012 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?

 59:004:013 Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:

 59:004:014 Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.

 59:004:015 For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.

 59:004:016 But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.

 59:004:017 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.

 59:005:001 Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.

 59:005:002 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.

 59:005:003 Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.

 59:005:004 Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.

 59:005:005 Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.

 59:005:006 Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.

 59:005:007 Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.

 59:005:008 Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

 59:005:009 Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.

 59:005:010 Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.

 59:005:011 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.

 59:005:012 But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.

 59:005:013 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.

 59:005:014 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:

 59:005:015 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.

 59:005:016 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

 59:005:017 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.

 59:005:018 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.

 59:005:019 Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;

 59:005:020 Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.

 Book 60 1 Peter

 60:001:001 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,

 60:001:002 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.

 60:001:003 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

 60:001:004 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,

 60:001:005 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.

 60:001:006 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:

 60:001:007 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:

 60:001:008 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:

 60:001:009 Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.

 60:001:010 Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:

 60:001:011 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.

 60:001:012 Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.

 60:001:013 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;

 60:001:014 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:

 60:001:015 But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;

 60:001:016 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.

 60:001:017 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:

 60:001:018 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;

 60:001:019 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:

 60:001:020 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,

 60:001:021 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.

 60:001:022 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:

 60:001:023 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.

 60:001:024 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:

 60:001:025 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.

 60:002:001 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,

 60:002:002 As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:

 60:002:003 If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

 60:002:004 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,

 60:002:005 Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.

 60:002:006 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.

 60:002:007 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,

 60:002:008 And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.

 60:002:009 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;

 60:002:010 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.

 60:002:011 Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;

 60:002:012 Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.

 60:002:013 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;

 60:002:014 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.

 60:002:015 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:

 60:002:016 As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.

 60:002:017 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.

 60:002:018 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.

 60:002:019 For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.

 60:002:020 For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.

 60:002:021 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:

 60:002:022 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:

 60:002:023 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:

 60:002:024 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.

 60:002:025 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

 60:003:001 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;

 60:003:002 While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.

 60:003:003 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;

 60:003:004 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.

 60:003:005 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:

 60:003:006 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.

 60:003:007 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.

 60:003:008 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:

 60:003:009 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.

 60:003:010 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:

 60:003:011 Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.

 60:003:012 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.

 60:003:013 And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?

 60:003:014 But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;

 60:003:015 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:

 60:003:016 Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.

 60:003:017 For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.

 60:003:018 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:

 60:003:019 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;

 60:003:020 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.

 60:003:021 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:

 60:003:022 Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.

 60:004:001 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;

 60:004:002 That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.

 60:004:003 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:

 60:004:004 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:

 60:004:005 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.

 60:004:006 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.

 60:004:007 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.

 60:004:008 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.

 60:004:009 Use hospitality one to another without grudging.

 60:004:010 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

 60:004:011 If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

 60:004:012 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:

 60:004:013 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.

 60:004:014 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.

 60:004:015 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.

 60:004:016 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.

 60:004:017 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?

 60:004:018 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?

 60:004:019 Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.

 60:005:001 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:

 60:005:002 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;

 60:005:003 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.

 60:005:004 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.

 60:005:005 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.

 60:005:006 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:

 60:005:007 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.

 60:005:008 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:

 60:005:009 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.

 60:005:010 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.

 60:005:011 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

 60:005:012 By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.

 60:005:013 The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.

 60:005:014 Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.

 Book 61 2 Peter

 61:001:001 Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:

 61:001:002 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,

 61:001:003 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:

 61:001:004 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.

 61:001:005 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;

 61:001:006 And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;

 61:001:007 And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.

 61:001:008 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

 61:001:009 But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.

 61:001:010 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:

 61:001:011 For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

 61:001:012 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.

 61:001:013 Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;

 61:001:014 Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.

 61:001:015 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.

 61:001:016 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.

 61:001:017 For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

 61:001:018 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.

 61:001:019 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:

 61:001:020 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.

 61:001:021 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

 61:002:001 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.

 61:002:002 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.

 61:002:003 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.

 61:002:004 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;

 61:002:005 And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;

 61:002:006 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;

 61:002:007 And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:

 61:002:008 (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)

 61:002:009 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:

 61:002:010 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.

 61:002:011 Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.

 61:002:012 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;

 61:002:013 And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;

 61:002:014 Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:

 61:002:015 Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;

 61:002:016 But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.

 61:002:017 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.

 61:002:018 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.

 61:002:019 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.

 61:002:020 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.

 61:002:021 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.

 61:002:022 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.

 61:003:001 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:

 61:003:002 That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:

 61:003:003 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,

 61:003:004 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.

 61:003:005 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:

 61:003:006 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:

 61:003:007 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.

 61:003:008 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.

 61:003:009 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

 61:003:010 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.

 61:003:011 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,

 61:003:012 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?

 61:003:013 Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.

 61:003:014 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.

 61:003:015 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;

 61:003:016 As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.

 61:003:017 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.

 61:003:018 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.

 Book 62 1 John

 62:001:001 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;

 62:001:002 (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)

 62:001:003 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.

 62:001:004 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.

 62:001:005 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.

 62:001:006 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:

 62:001:007 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.

 62:001:008 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

 62:001:009 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

 62:001:010 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

 62:002:001 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:

 62:002:002 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.

 62:002:003 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.

 62:002:004 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

 62:002:005 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.

 62:002:006 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.

 62:002:007 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.

 62:002:008 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.

 62:002:009 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.

 62:002:010 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.

 62:002:011 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.

 62:002:012 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.

 62:002:013 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.

 62:002:014 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.

 62:002:015 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

 62:002:016 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.

 62:002:017 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.

 62:002:018 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.

 62:002:019 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.

 62:002:020 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.

 62:002:021 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.

 62:002:022 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.

 62:002:023 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.

 62:002:024 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.

 62:002:025 And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.

 62:002:026 These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.

 62:002:027 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.

 62:002:028 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

 62:002:029 If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.

 62:003:001 Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.

 62:003:002 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.

 62:003:003 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.

 62:003:004 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.

 62:003:005 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.

 62:003:006 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.

 62:003:007 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.

 62:003:008 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.

 62:003:009 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.

 62:003:010 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.

 62:003:011 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.

 62:003:012 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.

 62:003:013 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.

 62:003:014 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.

 62:003:015 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.

 62:003:016 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.

 62:003:017 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?

 62:003:018 My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.

 62:003:019 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.

 62:003:020 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.

 62:003:021 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.

 62:003:022 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.

 62:003:023 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.

 62:003:024 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.

 62:004:001 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.

 62:004:002 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:

 62:004:003 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.

 62:004:004 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.

 62:004:005 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.

 62:004:006 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.

 62:004:007 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.

 62:004:008 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.

 62:004:009 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.

 62:004:010 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

 62:004:011 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.

 62:004:012 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.

 62:004:013 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.

 62:004:014 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.

 62:004:015 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.

 62:004:016 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.

 62:004:017 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.

 62:004:018 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.

 62:004:019 We love him, because he first loved us.

 62:004:020 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?

 62:004:021 And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.

 62:005:001 Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.

 62:005:002 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.

 62:005:003 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.

 62:005:004 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.

 62:005:005 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?

 62:005:006 This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.

 62:005:007 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.

 62:005:008 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.

 62:005:009 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.

 62:005:010 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.

 62:005:011 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.

 62:005:012 He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.

 62:005:013 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.

 62:005:014 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:

 62:005:015 And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.

 62:005:016 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.

 62:005:017 All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.

 62:005:018 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.

 62:005:019 And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.

 62:005:020 And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.

 62:005:021 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.

 Book 63 2 John

 63:001:001 The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;

 63:001:002 For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.

 63:001:003 Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

 63:001:004 I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.

 63:001:005 And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.

 63:001:006 And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.

 63:001:007 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.

 63:001:008 Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.

 63:001:009 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.

 63:001:010 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:

 63:001:011 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.

 63:001:012 Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.

 63:001:013 The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.

 Book 64 3 John

 64:001:001 The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.

 64:001:002 Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.

 64:001:003 For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.

 64:001:004 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.

 64:001:005 Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;

 64:001:006 Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:

 64:001:007 Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.

 64:001:008 We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.

 64:001:009 I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.

 64:001:010 Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.

 64:001:011 Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.

 64:001:012 Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.

 64:001:013 I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:

 64:001:014 But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.

 Book 65 Jude

 65:001:001 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:

 65:001:002 Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.

 65:001:003 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.

 65:001:004 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.

 65:001:005 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.

 65:001:006 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.

 65:001:007 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.

 65:001:008 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.

 65:001:009 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.

 65:001:010 But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.

 65:001:011 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.

 65:001:012 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;

 65:001:013 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.

 65:001:014 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,

 65:001:015 To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.

 65:001:016 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.

 65:001:017 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;

 65:001:018 How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.

 65:001:019 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.

 65:001:020 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,

 65:001:021 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

 65:001:022 And of some have compassion, making a difference:

 65:001:023 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

 65:001:024 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,

 65:001:025 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.

 Book 66 Revelation

 66:001:001 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:

 66:001:002 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.

 66:001:003 Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.

 66:001:004 John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;

 66:001:005 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,

 66:001:006 And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

 66:001:007 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.

 66:001:008 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.

 66:001:009 I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.

 66:001:010 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,

 66:001:011 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.

 66:001:012 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;

 66:001:013 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.

 66:001:014 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;

 66:001:015 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.

 66:001:016 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.

 66:001:017 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:

 66:001:018 I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.

 66:001:019 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;

 66:001:020 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.

 66:002:001 Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;

 66:002:002 I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:

 66:002:003 And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.

 66:002:004 Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.

 66:002:005 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.

 66:002:006 But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.

 66:002:007 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

 66:002:008 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;

 66:002:009 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.

 66:002:010 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.

 66:002:011 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.

 66:002:012 And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;

 66:002:013 I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.

 66:002:014 But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.

 66:002:015 So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.

 66:002:016 Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.

 66:002:017 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.

 66:002:018 And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;

 66:002:019 I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.

 66:002:020 Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.

 66:002:021 And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.

 66:002:022 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.

 66:002:023 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.

 66:002:024 But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.

 66:002:025 But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.

 66:002:026 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:

 66:002:027 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.

 66:002:028 And I will give him the morning star.

 66:002:029 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

 66:003:001 And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.

 66:003:002 Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.

 66:003:003 Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.

 66:003:004 Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.

 66:003:005 He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.

 66:003:006 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

 66:003:007 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;

 66:003:008 I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.

 66:003:009 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.

 66:003:010 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.

 66:003:011 Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.

 66:003:012 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.

 66:003:013 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

 66:003:014 And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;

 66:003:015 I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.

 66:003:016 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.

 66:003:017 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:

 66:003:018 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.

 66:003:019 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.

 66:003:020 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.

 66:003:021 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.

 66:003:022 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

 66:004:001 After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.

 66:004:002 And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.

 66:004:003 And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.

 66:004:004 And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.

 66:004:005 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.

 66:004:006 And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.

 66:004:007 And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.

 66:004:008 And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.

 66:004:009 And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,

 66:004:010 The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,

 66:004:011 Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.

 66:005:001 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.

 66:005:002 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?

 66:005:003 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.

 66:005:004 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.

 66:005:005 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.

 66:005:006 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.

 66:005:007 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.

 66:005:008 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.

 66:005:009 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;

 66:005:010 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.

 66:005:011 And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;

 66:005:012 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.

 66:005:013 And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.

 66:005:014 And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.

 66:006:001 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.

 66:006:002 And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.

 66:006:003 And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.

 66:006:004 And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.

 66:006:005 And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.

 66:006:006 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.

 66:006:007 And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.

 66:006:008 And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.

 66:006:009 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:

 66:006:010 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?

 66:006:011 And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.

 66:006:012 And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;

 66:006:013 And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.

 66:006:014 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.

 66:006:015 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;

 66:006:016 And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:

 66:006:017 For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?

 66:007:001 And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.

 66:007:002 And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,

 66:007:003 Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.

 66:007:004 And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.

 66:007:005 Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand.

 66:007:006 Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand.

 66:007:007 Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.

 66:007:008 Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.

 66:007:009 After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;

 66:007:010 And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.

 66:007:011 And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,

 66:007:012 Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.

 66:007:013 And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?

 66:007:014 And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

 66:007:015 Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.

 66:007:016 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.

 66:007:017 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.

 66:008:001 And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.

 66:008:002 And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.

 66:008:003 And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.

 66:008:004 And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.

 66:008:005 And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.

 66:008:006 And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.

 66:008:007 The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.

 66:008:008 And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;

 66:008:009 And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.

 66:008:010 And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;

 66:008:011 And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.

 66:008:012 And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.

 66:008:013 And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!

 66:009:001 And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.

 66:009:002 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.

 66:009:003 And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.

 66:009:004 And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.

 66:009:005 And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.

 66:009:006 And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.

 66:009:007 And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.

 66:009:008 And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.

 66:009:009 And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.

 66:009:010 And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.

 66:009:011 And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.

 66:009:012 One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.

 66:009:013 And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,

 66:009:014 Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.

 66:009:015 And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.

 66:009:016 And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.

 66:009:017 And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.

 66:009:018 By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.

 66:009:019 For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.

 66:009:020 And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:

 66:009:021 Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.

 66:010:001 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:

 66:010:002 And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,

 66:010:003 And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.

 66:010:004 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.

 66:010:005 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,

 66:010:006 And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:

 66:010:007 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.

 66:010:008 And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.

 66:010:009 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.

 66:010:010 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.

 66:010:011 And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.

 66:011:001 And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.

 66:011:002 But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.

 66:011:003 And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.

 66:011:004 These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.

 66:011:005 And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.

 66:011:006 These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.

 66:011:007 And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.

 66:011:008 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.

 66:011:009 And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.

 66:011:010 And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.

 66:011:011 And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.

 66:011:012 And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.

 66:011:013 And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.

 66:011:014 The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.

 66:011:015 And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.

 66:011:016 And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,

 66:011:017 Saying, We give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.

 66:011:018 And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.

 66:011:019 And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.

 66:012:001 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:

 66:012:002 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.

 66:012:003 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.

 66:012:004 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.

 66:012:005 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.

 66:012:006 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.

 66:012:007 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,

 66:012:008 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.

 66:012:009 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

 66:012:010 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.

 66:012:011 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.

 66:012:012 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.

 66:012:013 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.

 66:012:014 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.

 66:012:015 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.

 66:012:016 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.

 66:012:017 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

 66:013:001 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.

 66:013:002 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.

 66:013:003 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.

 66:013:004 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?

 66:013:005 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.

 66:013:006 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.

 66:013:007 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.

 66:013:008 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

 66:013:009 If any man have an ear, let him hear.

 66:013:010 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

 66:013:011 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.

 66:013:012 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.

 66:013:013 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,

 66:013:014 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.

 66:013:015 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.

 66:013:016 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:

 66:013:017 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

 66:013:018 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.

 66:014:001 And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.

 66:014:002 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:

 66:014:003 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.

 66:014:004 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.

 66:014:005 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.

 66:014:006 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,

 66:014:007 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.

 66:014:008 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

 66:014:009 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,

 66:014:010 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:

 66:014:011 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

 66:014:012 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

 66:014:013 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.

 66:014:014 And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.

 66:014:015 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.

 66:014:016 And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.

 66:014:017 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.

 66:014:018 And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.

 66:014:019 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.

 66:014:020 And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.

 66:015:001 And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.

 66:015:002 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.

 66:015:003 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.

 66:015:004 Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.

 66:015:005 And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:

 66:015:006 And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.

 66:015:007 And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.

 66:015:008 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.

 66:016:001 And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.

 66:016:002 And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.

 66:016:003 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.

 66:016:004 And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.

 66:016:005 And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.

 66:016:006 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.

 66:016:007 And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.

 66:016:008 And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.

 66:016:009 And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.

 66:016:010 And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,

 66:016:011 And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.

 66:016:012 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.

 66:016:013 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.

 66:016:014 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.

 66:016:015 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.

 66:016:016 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.

 66:016:017 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.

 66:016:018 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.

 66:016:019 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.

 66:016:020 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.

 66:016:021 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.

 66:017:001 And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:

 66:017:002 With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.

 66:017:003 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.

 66:017:004 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:

 66:017:005 And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.

 66:017:006 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.

 66:017:007 And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.

 66:017:008 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.

 66:017:009 And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.

 66:017:010 And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.

 66:017:011 And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.

 66:017:012 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.

 66:017:013 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.

 66:017:014 These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.

 66:017:015 And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.

 66:017:016 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.

 66:017:017 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.

 66:017:018 And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.

 66:018:001 And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.

 66:018:002 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.

 66:018:003 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.

 66:018:004 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.

 66:018:005 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.

 66:018:006 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.

 66:018:007 How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.

 66:018:008 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.

 66:018:009 And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,

 66:018:010 Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.

 66:018:011 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:

 66:018:012 The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,

 66:018:013 And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.

 66:018:014 And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.

 66:018:015 The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,

 66:018:016 And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!

 66:018:017 For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,

 66:018:018 And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!

 66:018:019 And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.

 66:018:020 Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.

 66:018:021 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.

 66:018:022 And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;

 66:018:023 And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.

 66:018:024 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.

 66:019:001 And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:

 66:019:002 For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.

 66:019:003 And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.

 66:019:004 And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.

 66:019:005 And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.

 66:019:006 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

 66:019:007 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.

 66:019:008 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.

 66:019:009 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.

 66:019:010 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

 66:019:011 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.

 66:019:012 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.

 66:019:013 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.

 66:019:014 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

 66:019:015 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.

 66:019:016 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

 66:019:017 And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;

 66:019:018 That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.

 66:019:019 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.

 66:019:020 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.

 66:019:021 And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.

 66:020:001 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.

 66:020:002 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,

 66:020:003 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.

 66:020:004 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.

 66:020:005 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.

 66:020:006 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.

 66:020:007 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,

 66:020:008 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.

 66:020:009 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.

 66:020:010 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

 66:020:011 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.

 66:020:012 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.

 66:020:013 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.

 66:020:014 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.

 66:020:015 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

 66:021:001 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.

 66:021:002 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

 66:021:003 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.

 66:021:004 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.

 66:021:005 And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.

 66:021:006 And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.

 66:021:007 He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.

 66:021:008 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

 66:021:009 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.

 66:021:010 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,

 66:021:011 Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;

 66:021:012 And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:

 66:021:013 On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.

 66:021:014 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

 66:021:015 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.

 66:021:016 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.

 66:021:017 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.

 66:021:018 And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.

 66:021:019 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;

 66:021:020 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.

 66:021:021 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.

 66:021:022 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.

 66:021:023 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.

 66:021:024 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.

 66:021:025 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.

 66:021:026 And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.

 66:021:027 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.

 66:022:001 And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.

 66:022:002 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.

 66:022:003 And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:

 66:022:004 And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.

 66:022:005 And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.

 66:022:006 And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.

 66:022:007 Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.

 66:022:008 And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things.

 66:022:009 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.

 66:022:010 And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.

 66:022:011 He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.

 66:022:012 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.

 66:022:013 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.

 66:022:014 Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.

 66:022:015 For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.

 66:022:016 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.

 66:022:017 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.

 66:022:018 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:

 66:022:019 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.

 66:022:020 He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.

 66:022:021 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

 Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we usually do not keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

 We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing. Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections, even years after the official publication date.

 Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement. The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month. A preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment and editing by those who wish to do so.

 Most people start at our Web sites at: http://gutenberg.net or http://promo.net/pg

 These Web sites include award-winning information about Project Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).

 Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement can get to them as follows, and just download by date. This is also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

 Information about Project Gutenberg

 (one page)

 We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work. The time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. Our projected audience is one hundred million readers. If the value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2 million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+ We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002 If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

 The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks! This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers, which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

 Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
